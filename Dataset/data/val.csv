31141729,Facile spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy for the discrimination of alpha and beta thalassemia traits and diseases: A photodiagnosis approach.,"Thalassemia (Thal) is an inherited blood disorder endemic to the Mediterranean and Middle East (e.g., KSA and UAE). This disease is caused by defects in the synthesis of one or more hemoglobin chains in red blood cells (RBCs). Alpha (alpha) Thal is caused by a reduced or absent alpha globin segment. Similarly, beta (beta) Thal is caused by a defect in the beta globin segment. We divided the diseases into four groups: alpha Thal trait, alpha Thal disease, beta Thal trait, and beta Thal disease. The alpha or beta Thal traits are milder variants of these diseases and do not require treatment; but beta Thal disease (and to a lesser extent, alpha Thal) causes hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and bone deformities and requires repeated lifelong blood transfusions. This paper presents results regarding the identification of Thal variants using fluorescence spectroscopy of blood biomolecules and atomic force microscopy analysis of the morphologic features of red blood cells. The combined results provide new insights into the characteristics of these diseases. Furthermore, this study shows why beta Thal disease subjects are often transfusion-dependent, and alpha Thal disease subjects are only occasionally transfusion dependent.",31141729.txt,0
38040034,Neurological disease in xeroderma pigmentosum: prospective cohort study of its features and progression.,"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) results from biallelic mutations in any of eight genes involved in DNA repair systems, thus defining eight different genotypes (XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, XPG and XP variant or XPV). In addition to cutaneous and ophthalmological features, some patients present with XP neurological disease. It is unknown whether the different neurological signs and their progression differ among groups. Therefore, we aim to characterize the XP neurological disease and its evolution in the heterogeneous UK XP cohort. Patients with XP were followed in the UK National XP Service, from 2009 to 2021. Age of onset for different events was recorded. Cerebellar ataxia and additional neurological signs and symptoms were rated with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS) and the Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (ADL). Patients' mutations received scores based on their predicted effects. Data from available ancillary tests were collected. Ninety-three XP patients were recruited. Thirty-six (38.7%) reported neurological symptoms, especially in the XPA, XPD and XPG groups, with early-onset and late-onset forms, and typically appearing after cutaneous and ophthalmological symptoms. XPA, XPD and XPG patients showed higher SARA scores compared to XPC, XPE and XPV. SARA total scores significantly increased over time in XPD (0.91 points/year, 95% confidence interval: 0.61, 1.21) and XPA (0.63 points/year, 95% confidence interval: 0.38, 0.89). Hyporeflexia, hypopallesthaesia, upper motor neuron signs, chorea, dystonia, oculomotor signs and cognitive impairment were frequent findings in XPA, XPD and XPG. Cerebellar and global brain atrophy, axonal sensory and sensorimotor neuropathies, and sensorineural hearing loss were common findings in patients. Some XPC, XPE and XPV cases presented with abnormalities on examination and/or ancillary tests, suggesting underlying neurological involvement. More severe mutations were associated with a faster progression in SARA total score in XPA (0.40 points/year per 1-unit increase in severity score) and XPD (0.60 points/year per 1-unit increase), and in ADL total score in XPA (0.35 points/year per 1-unit increase). Symptomatic and asymptomatic forms of neurological disease are frequent in XP patients, and neurological symptoms can be an important cause of disability. Typically, the neurological disease will be preceded by cutaneous and ophthalmological features, and these should be actively searched in patients with idiopathic late-onset neurological syndromes. Scales assessing cerebellar function, especially walking and speech, and disability can show progression in some of the groups. Mutation severity can be used as a prognostic biomarker for stratification purposes in clinical trials.",38040034.txt,0
30897768,Breast Cancer and miR-SNPs: The Importance of miR Germ-Line Genetics.,"Recent studies in cancer diagnostics have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) as promising cancer biomarkers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA binding sites, seed regions, and coding sequences can help predict breast cancer risk, aggressiveness, response to stimuli, and prognosis. This review also documents significant known miR-SNPs in miRNA biogenesis genes and their effects on gene regulation in breast cancer, taking into account the genetic background and ethnicity of the sampled populations. When applicable, miR-SNPs are evaluated in the context of other patient factors, including mutations, hormonal status, and demographics. Given the power of miR-SNPs to predict patient cancer risk, prognosis, and outcomes, further study of miR-SNPs is warranted to improve efforts towards personalized medicine.",30897768.txt,1
38583503,Transcriptome and Metabolome analysis reveal HFPO-TA induced disorders of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in rat by interfering with PPAR signaling pathway.,"PFOA is one of the most representative compounds in the family of perfluorinated organic compounds. Due to its varying toxicity, alternatives to PFOA are beginning to emerge. HFPO-TA is an alternative for PFOA. It is currently unclear whether HFPO-TA affects glucose and lipid metabolism. In this study, rats were used as an animal model to investigate the effects of HFPO-TA on liver glucose and lipid metabolism. We found that HFPO-TA can affect glucose tolerance. Through omics analysis and molecular detection, it was found that HFPO-TA mainly affects the PPAR signaling pathway in the liver of rats, inhibiting liver glycolysis while promoting glucose production. HFPO-TA not only promotes the synthesis of fatty acids in the liver, but also promotes the breakdown of fatty acids, which ultimately leads to the disruption of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. The effects of HFPO-TA on metabolism are discussed in this paper to provide a reference for the risk assessment of this PFOA substitute.",38583503.txt,0

31168756,High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry and Impedance: Protocols and Metrics-Recommendations of a High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry International Working Group.,"High-resolution manometry has traditionally been utilized in gastroenterology diagnostic clinical and research applications. Recently, it is also finding new and important applications in speech pathology and laryngology practices. A High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry International Working Group was formed as a grass roots effort to establish a consensus on methodology, protocol, and outcome metrics for high-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRPM) with consideration of impedance as an adjunct modality. The Working Group undertook three tasks (1) survey what experts were currently doing in their clinical and/or research practice; (2) perform a review of the literature underpinning the value of particular HRPM metrics for understanding swallowing physiology and pathophysiology; and (3) establish a core outcomes set of HRPM metrics via a Delphi consensus process. Expert survey results were used to create a recommended HRPM protocol addressing system configuration, catheter insertion, and bolus administration. Ninety two articles were included in the final literature review resulting in categorization of 22 HRPM-impedance metrics into three classes: pharyngeal lumen occlusive pressures, hypopharyngeal intrabolus pressures, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function. A stable Delphi consensus was achieved for 8 HRPM-Impedance metrics: pharyngeal contractile integral (CI), velopharyngeal CI, hypopharyngeal CI, hypopharyngeal pressure at nadir impedance, UES integrated relaxation pressure, relaxation time, and maximum admittance. While some important unanswered questions remain, our work represents the first step in standardization of high-resolution pharyngeal manometry acquisition, measurement, and reporting. This could potentially inform future proposals for an HRPM-based classification system specifically for pharyngeal swallowing disorders.",31168756.txt,0
37407995,Protocadherin 20 maintains intestinal barrier function to protect against Crohn's disease by targeting ATF6.,"Intestinal barrier dysfunction plays a central role in the pathological onset of Crohn's disease. We identify the cadherin superfamily member protocadherin 20 (PCDH20) as a crucial factor in Crohn's disease. Here we describe the function of PCDH20 and its mechanisms in gut homeostasis, barrier integrity, and Crohn's disease development.
PCDH20 mRNA and protein expression is significantly downregulated in the colonic epithelium of Crohn's disease patients and mice with induced colitis compared with controls. In mice, intestinal-specific Pcdh20 knockout causes defects in enterocyte proliferation and differentiation, while causing morphological abnormalities. Specifically, the deletion disrupts barrier integrity by unzipping adherens junctions via β-catenin regulation and p120-catenin phosphorylation, thus aggravating colitis in DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis mouse models. Furthermore, we identify activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key chaperone of endoplasmic reticulum stress, as a functional downstream effector of PCDH20. By administering a selective ATF6 activator, the impairment of intestinal barrier integrity and dysregulation of CHOP/β-catenin/p-p120-catenin pathway was reversed in Pcdh20-ablated mice with colitis and PCDH20-deficient colonic cell lines.
PCDH20 is an essential factor in maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis and barrier integrity. Specifically, PCDH20 helps to protect against colitis by tightening adherens junctions through the ATF6/CHOP/β-catenin/p-p120-catenin axis.",37407995.txt,0
31299995,"Genomic landscape and its correlations with tumor mutational burden, PD-L1 expression, and immune cells infiltration in Chinese lung squamous cell carcinoma.","INTRODUCTION: To depict the genomic landscape of Chinese early-stage lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and investigate its correlation with tumor mutation burden (TMB), PD-L1 expression, and immune infiltrates. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 189 surgically resected LUSC. TMB was defined as the sum of nonsynonymous single nucleotide and indel variants. CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density and PD-L1 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Six immune infiltrates were estimated using an online database. RESULTS: The median TMB was 9.43 mutations per megabase. Positive PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TILs density were identified in 24.3% and 78.8%. PIK3CA amplification was associated with significantly higher TMB (P = 0.036). Frequent genetic alterations had no impact on PD-L1 expression but PIK3CA amplification and KEAP1 mutation were independently associated with significantly lower CD8+ TIL density (P < 0.001, P = 0.005, respectively). Low TMB and high CD8+ TIL density were independently associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS) while none of them could individually predict the overall survival (OS). Combination of TMB and PD-L1 expression or TMB and CD8+ TIL density could stratify total populations into two groups with distinct prognosis. Classifying tumor-immune microenvironment based on PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TIL density showed discrepant genomic alterations but similar TMB, clinical features, and OS. Notably, patients with different smoking status had distinct prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: The combination of TMB, PD-L1 expression, immune infiltrates, and smoking status showed the feasibility to subgroup stratification in Chinese patients with early-stage LUSC, which might be helpful for future design of personalized immunotherapy trials in LUSC.",31299995.txt,1
29059455,Angiocrine Wnt signaling controls liver growth and metabolic maturation in mice.,"Postnatal liver development is characterized by hepatocyte growth, proliferation, and functional maturation. Notably, canonical Wnt signaling in hepatocytes has been identified as an important regulator of final adult liver size and metabolic liver zonation. The cellular origin of Wnt ligands responsible for homeostatic liver/body weight ratio (LW/BW) remained unclear, which was also attributable to a lack of suitable endothelial Cre driver mice. To comprehensively analyze the effects of hepatic angiocrine Wnt signaling on liver development and metabolic functions, we used endothelial subtype-specific Stab2-Cre driver mice to delete Wls from hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). The resultant Stab2-Cretg/wt ;Wlsfl/fl (Wls-HECKO) mice were viable, but showed a significantly reduced LW/BW. Specifically, ablation of angiocrine Wnt signaling impaired metabolic zonation in the liver, as shown by loss of pericentral, beta-catenin-dependent target genes such as glutamine synthase (Glul), RhBg, Axin2, and cytochrome P450 2E1, as well as by extended expression of periportal genes such as arginase 1. Furthermore, endothelial subtype-specific expression of a c-terminally YFP-tagged Wls fusion protein in Wls-HECKO mice (Stab2-Cretg/wt ;Wlsfl/fl ;Rosa26:Wls-YFPfl/wt [Wls-rescue]) restored metabolic liver zonation. Interestingly, lipid metabolism was altered in Wls-HECKO mice exhibiting significantly reduced plasma cholesterol levels, while maintaining normal plasma triglyceride and blood glucose concentrations. On the contrary, zonal expression of Endomucin, LYVE1, and other markers of HEC heterogeneity were not altered in Wls-HECKO livers. CONCLUSION: Angiocrine Wnt signaling controls liver growth as well as development of metabolic liver zonation in mice, whereas intrahepatic HEC zonation is not affected.

It can be difficult to differentiate plasmablastic lymphoma of the cervix from cervical plasmablastic plasma cell myeloma. The clinician must rely on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings to diagnose genital plasma cell myeloma. Prompt diagnosis of this rare clinical condition can potentially allow timely treatment with systemic chemotherapy.",31249854.txt,1
30987226,Pathological and Molecular Features of Glioblastoma and Its Peritumoral Tissue.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal human brain tumors. At present, GBMs are divided in primary and secondary on the basis of the mutational status of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes. In addition, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are considered crucial to better define the prognosis. Although primary and secondary GBMs are histologically indistinguishable, they retain distinct genetic alterations that account for different evolution of the tumor. The high invasiveness, the propensity to disperse throughout the brain parenchyma, and the elevated vascularity make these tumors extremely recidivist, resulting in a short patient median survival even after surgical resection and chemoradiotherapy. Furthermore, GBM is considered an immunologically cold tumor. Several studies highlight a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that promotes recurrence and poor prognosis. Deeper insight into the tumor immune microenvironment, together with the recent discovery of a conventional lymphatic system in the central nervous system (CNS), led to new immunotherapeutic strategies. In the last two decades, experimental evidence from different groups proved the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), also known as tumor-initiating cells, that may play an active role in tumor development and progression. Recent findings also indicated the presence of highly infiltrative CSCs in the peritumoral region of GBM. This region appears to play a key role in tumor growing and recurrence. However, until recently, few studies investigated the biomolecular characteristics of the peritumoral tissue. The aim of this review is to recapitulate the pathological features of GBM and of the peritumoral region associated with progression and recurrence.",30987226.txt,1
31516752,Loss of PSP94 expression is associated with early PSA recurrence and deteriorates outcome of PTEN deleted prostate cancers.,"OBJECTIVE: Prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94) is a target gene of the EZH2 transcriptional repressor and is often downregulated in prostate cancer; however, its prognostic value is disputed. METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray of 12, 432 prostate cancer specimens was performed to evaluate PSP94 expression. Correlation of PSP94 expression with tumor phenotype, patient prognosis, TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status, EZH2 expression and PTEN deletion was studied. RESULTS: PSP94 expression was increased in benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, it was downregulated in 48% and negative in 42% of the 9, 881 interpretable prostate cancer specimens. The loss of PSP94 expression was inversely correlated to EZH2 expression (P < 0.0001) and largely unrelated to the ERG status, but strongly correlated with high Gleason grade, advanced tumor stage, and nodal metastasis ( P <0.0001 each). The fraction of PSP94-negative cancer specimens increased from 40% in pT2 to 52% in pT3b-pT4 ( P < 0.0001) and from 40% in Gleason 3+3 = 6 to 46% in Gleason 4+3 = 7 and 60% in Gleason >=4+4 = 8 ( P < 0.0001). Loss of PSP94 was linked to early prostate-specific antigen recurrence, but with little absolute effect ( P < 0.0001). However, it provided additional prognostic impact in cancer specimens with PTEN deletion. Loss of PSP94 deteriorated prognosis of cancer patients with PTEN deletion by more than 10% (P < 0.0001). The combination of PTEN deletion and PSP94 loss provided independent prognostic information that was observed in several subgroups defined by classical and quantitative Gleason grade. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that combined PSP94/PTEN analysis can be potentially used in the clinical prognosis of prostate cancer.",31516752.txt,1
31540291,"Next-Generation Sequencing Improves Diagnosis, Prognosis and Clinical Management of Myeloid Neoplasms.","Molecular diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms (MN) is based on the detection of multiple genetic alterations using various techniques. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proved as a useful method for analyzing many genes simultaneously. In this context, we analyzed diagnostic samples from 121 patients affected by MN and ten relapse samples from a subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients using two enrichment-capture NGS gene panels. Pathogenicity classification of variants was enhanced by the development and application of a custom onco-hematology score. A total of 278 pathogenic variants were detected in 84% of patients. For structural alterations, 82% of those identified by cytogenetics were detected by NGS, 25 of 31 copy number variants and three out of three translocations. The detection of variants using NGS changed the diagnosis of seven patients and the prognosis of 15 patients and enabled us to identify 44 suitable candidates for clinical trials. Regarding AML, six of the ten relapsed patients lost or gained variants, comparing with diagnostic samples. In conclusion, the use of NGS panels in MN improves genetic characterization of the disease compared with conventional methods, thus demonstrating its potential clinical utility in routine clinical testing. This approach leads to better-adjusted treatments for each patient.",31540291.txt,1
37404298,Dynamic Rod Constructs as the Preventive Strategy against Adjacent Segment Disease in Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Disorders: A Retrospective Comparative Cohort Study.,"Adjacent segment degeneration (ASDe) and adjacent segment disease (ASDi) are potential long-term complications after lumbar fusion with rigid instrumentation. Dynamic fixation techniques (Topping-off) adjacent to the fused segments have been developed to curtail the risk of ASDe and ASDi. The current study sought to investigate whether the addition of dynamic rod constructs (DRC) in patients with preoperative degeneration in the adjacent disc was effective in reducing the risk of ASDi.
A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data of 207 patients with degenerative lumbar disorders (DLD) from January 2012 to January 2019, who underwent posterior transpedicular lumbar fusion (without Topping-off, NoT/O), and posterior dynamic instrumentation with DRC. Clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and lumbar radiographs one, three, and 12 months postoperatively and annually. ASDe was defined as disc height collapse > 20% and disc wedging > 5. Patients with confirmed ASDe and aggravation of ODI > 20 or VAS score > 5 at final follow-up were diagnosed as ASDi. The Kaplan-Meier hazard method was used to estimate the cumulative probability of ASDi within 63 months of surgery.
Over three years of follow-up, 65 patients in the NoT/O (59.6%) and 52 cases (53.1%) in the DRC groups met the diagnostic criteria for ASDe. Furthermore, 27 (24.8%) patients in the NoT/O group showed ASDi during the follow-up, compared to 14 (14.3%) cases in the DRC group (<i>P</i>=0.059). Revision surgery was performed on 19 individuals in the NoT/O and 8 cases in the DRC groups (<i>P</i>=0.048). The Cox regression model identified a significantly decreased risk of ASDi if DRC was used (Hazard ratio: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13-0.6).
Dynamic fixation adjacent to the fused segment is an effective strategy for preventing ASDi in carefully selected individuals with preoperative degenerative changes at the adjacent level.",37404298.txt,0
25759145,ATM gene single nucleotide polymorphisms predict regimen-related gastrointestinal toxicity in patients allografted after reduced conditioning.,"Polymorphisms of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity have become an object of major interest in regard to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complications. Regimen-related gastrointestinal toxicity (RR-GIT) is the dominant complication during the pre-engraftment period and has been linked to increased risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) development. According to our hypothesis, functional variants of genes participating in DNA damage response (DDR) may have an impact on the extent of tissue damage caused by the conditioning regimen. In our single-center study, we analyzed 62 patients who underwent HSCT from HLA-identical donors after reduced conditioning. The patients were genotyped for 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs4585 T/G, rs189037 A/G, rs227092 T/G, rs228590 C/T, and rs664677 T/C) of the ATM gene-the essential member of the DDR pathways, using allele-specific matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry assay. Because of almost absolute linkage disequilibrium observed among all 5 SNPs, association of 2 major ATM haplotypes (ATM1/ATM2) with RR-GIT and acute GVHD (aGVHD) was analyzed. Importantly, the univariate and multivariate analysis showed that patients homozygous for ATM2 haplotype (rs4585*T, rs189037*A, rs227092*T, rs228590*C, and rs664677*T) are more likely to suffer from high-grade RR-GIT than ATM1 homozygous patients. The association with aGVHD was not significant. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the ATM gene variability in relation to RR-GIT in the allogeneic HSCT setting.",25759145.txt,0

31054046,Osteosarcoma and second malignant neoplasms: a case series.,"BACKGROUND: The overall survival of patients with localised osteosarcoma has dramatically improved with the introduction of multidrug chemotherapeutic regimens into the treatment paradigm. However, despite optimal treatment, all-cause mortality remains higher among osteosarcoma survivors than in the general population. The development of second malignant neoplasms contributes to this higher mortality rate. CASE SERIES: We present three cases of patients definitively treated for osteosarcoma who subsequently developed a second malignant neoplasm. The first case describes a 17-year-old female with osteosarcoma of her right femur treated with surgical resection and perioperative chemotherapy. Ten years later, she was diagnosed with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Genetic testing identified a germline TP53 mutation, confirming the presence of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The second case details an 18-year-old male with osteosarcoma of his right humerus treated with definitive resection and perioperative chemotherapy. He was diagnosed with appendiceal adenocarcinoma after presenting with acute abdominal pain 17 years later. The third case reviewed is of a 36-year-old male with osteosarcoma of his right femur treated with definitive resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. A diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was made 7 years later following surveillance imaging. DISCUSSION: The risk of second malignant neoplasms in osteosarcoma may relate to previous oncological treatment, an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome or a spontaneous new neoplasm. Although screening for a second malignancy is not routinely recommended for osteosarcoma survivors, a high degree of clinical suspicion should be maintained during surveillance.",31054046.txt,1
31533138,[Predictive markers of immunotherapy of colorectal cancer].,"Colorectal carcinomas are heterogeneous in their morphologic, immunologic and molecular aspects. The smooth and sharply demarcated medullary carcinomas present with an expansive border and high tumor stroma ratio. The high load of cancer neoantigens as a consequence of microsatellite instability results in numerous reactive regional lymph nodes. In contrast, the low grade, MSS type carcinomas are spiculated, desmoplastic and hard, frequently with smaller and sometimes also desmoplastic lymph node metastases. This macroscopic and histological heterogeneity is mirrored on the immunohistochemical and molecular level and is decisive from prognostic and predictive point of view. As immunotherapy opened a new front in the therapy of colorectal cancer, the pathology report has to quantify and qualify the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, the peritumoral and intratumoral lymphoid infiltration and tumor stroma ratio in order to improve patient selection.",31533138.txt,1
26400824,Effect of a thrombopoietin receptor agonist on use of intravenous immune globulin in patients with immune thrombocytopenia.,"BACKGROUND: Thrombopoietin receptor agonists are new treatments for patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). How one of these agent, romiplostim, has impacted practice patterns, especially the use of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), has not been evaluated outside of clinical trials. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult ITP patients treated with romiplostim in four Canadian centers. Patients had primary or secondary ITP and were followed for 1 year before starting weekly romiplostim treatment. We compared IVIG use, clinical outcomes, and cost before and after romiplostim. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with ITP received romiplostim. Median age was 54 years (interquartile range [IQR], 45-63 years) and patients had a median of two prior ITP treatments (IQR, 1-4) including splenectomy (n = 7). Median platelet (PLT) count was 23 x 10(9) before and 124 x 10(9) after romiplostim. Median duration of romiplostim treatment was 3.7 months. Patients used a median of two IVIG infusions per year before and 0.7 per year after starting romiplostim (p = 0.16). For patients who received weekly romiplostim for at least 1 month (n = 19), IVIG infusions were three (IQR, 1-5) per year before and 0.7 (IQR, 0.4-1.6) per year after romiplostim. Results were squewed by two high IVIG users. Nineteen (66%) patients discontinued romiplostim treatment during follow-up because of lack of response (n = 8), sustained response (n = 5), toxicities (n = 4), or response to splenectomy (n = 2). Overall health care costs were similar before and after romiplostim when concomitant treatments, nursing resources, and hospitalizations were considered. CONCLUSIONS: Romiplostim was associated with improved PLT counts and fewer IVIG infusions for most ITP patients. In practice, romiplostim was generally not continued long term and was cost neutral for overall ITP management.",26400824.txt,0
31608732,Liquid biopsy tracking of lung tumor evolutions over time.,"Introduction: The rise of the personalized era in lung cancer prompted the evaluation of novel diagnostic tools to overcome some of the limits of traditional tumor genotyping. Liquid biopsy refers to a multitude of minimally invasive techniques that can allow a real-time biomolecular characterization of the tumor through the analysis of human body fluids.Areas covered: Herein we provide a comprehensive overview of the role of liquid biopsy in lung cancer, mainly focusing on the most studied members of the liquid biopsy family, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs).Expert opinion: Among the different components of the large liquid biopsy family, cfDNA is the most studied and widely adopted source for tumor genotyping in lung cancer, already entered clinical practice for detection of both sensitizing and resistance EGFR mutations. However, the impressive technological advances made in the last few years are expanding its potential applications, allowing a more comprehensive plasma genotyping through next-generation sequencing and moving from advanced/metastatic disease to novel frontiers, such as early detection and minimal residual disease evaluation.",31608732.txt,1
36719787,Intratumor Injection of Thermosensitive Polypeptide with Resveratrol Inhibits Glioblastoma Growth.,"Local tumor treatment is a feasible measure for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) who are unsuitable for surgical resection. Interferon-elastin-like polypeptide [IFN-ELP(V)] is a slow-release, biodegradable, thermosensitive fusion protein with antitumor immunity, and resveratrol (Res) is a polyphenolic compound with an antitumor effect. In this study, we found that intratumor injection of IFN-ELP(V) combined with intraperitoneal injection of Res is more effective in delaying GBM growth in mice. Specifically, in an orthotopic GBM model, we found a significant improvement in the median survival with this strategy. Our results suggested that the combined use of IFN-ELP(V) and Res has a dramatic synergistic effect on GBM, thus providing a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for tumors. Impact statement We report a novel and effective strategy in which the combined use of interferon-elastin-like polypeptide [IFN-ELP(V)] and Res effectively inhibits glioblastoma growth. IFN-ELP(V) can create a reservoir in the tumor and continuously release IFN to produce a powerful <i>in situ</i> antitumor immune response; furthermore, the combination of IFN-ELP(V) and Res is more effective in inhibiting tumor growth.",36719787.txt,1
25837692,The clinical and laboratory evaluation of the patient with erythrocytosis.,"Erythrocytosis is frequently encountered as an incidental abnormality on laboratory testing that reveals persistent elevation of the hematocrit level (>52% in men and >48% in women). In many cases, erythrocytosis is the manifestation of an underlying cardiopulmonary process, drug-induced due to androgens, or secondary to smoking, rather than a primary bone marrow disorder such as polycythemia vera. A systematic approach to the clinical and laboratory evaluation of each patient is indicated to consider diverse differential diagnosis possibilities and to identify the underlying etiology of erythrocytosis in order to formulate appropriate subspecialist referral and management plans. A thorough medical history and meticulous physical examination supplemented by a focused initial laboratory evaluation will enable the general practitioner to ascertain the etiology of erythrocytosis in the majority of cases. Patients with clinical and laboratory features suggestive of polycythemia vera and those patients without an apparent underlying condition known to cause erythrocytosis benefit from early referral to a hematologist for further specialized diagnostic evaluation and therapy considerations.",25837692.txt,0
30051161,Toxoplasma gondii chromosomal passenger complex is essential for the organization of a functional mitotic spindle: a prerequisite for productive endodyogeny.,"The phylum Apicomplexa encompasses deadly pathogens such as malaria and Cryptosporidium. Apicomplexa cell division is mechanistically divergent from that of their mammalian host, potentially representing an attractive source of drug targets. Depending on the species, apicomplexan parasites can modulate the output of cell division, producing two to thousands of daughter cells at once. The inherent flexibility of their cell division mechanisms allows these parasites to adapt to different niches, facilitating their dissemination. Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites divide using a unique form of cell division called endodyogeny. This process involves a single round of DNA replication, closed nuclear mitosis, and assembly of two daughter cells within a mother. In higher Eukaryotes, the four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) (Aurora kinase B (ARKB)/INCENP/Borealin/Survivin) promotes chromosome bi-orientation by detaching incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments, playing an essential role in controlling cell division fidelity. Herein, we report the characterization of the Toxoplasma CPC (Aurora kinase 1 (Ark1)/INCENP1/INCENP2). We show that the CPC exhibits dynamic localization in a cell cycle-dependent manner. TgArk1 interacts with both TgINCENPs, with TgINCENP2 being essential for its translocation to the nucleus. While TgINCENP1 appears to be dispensable, interfering with TgArk1 or TgINCENP2 results in pronounced division and growth defects. Significant anti-cancer drug development efforts have focused on targeting human ARKB. Parasite treatment with low doses of hesperadin, a known inhibitor of human ARKB at higher concentrations, phenocopies the TgArk1 and TgINCENP2 mutants. Overall, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underpinning cell cycle control in Apicomplexa, and highlights TgArk1 as potential drug target.",30051161.txt,0
30124220,[A case of growth hormone deficiency combined with neurofibromatosis Type 1 and its gene analysis].,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by NF1 gene mutations. Cafe au lait spots, neurofibromatosis, Lisch nodules, axillary freckling, dermal neurofibromas and skeletal dysplasia are the most common manifestations for this disease. A 11-year-old boy visited Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University due to growth-retardation. He was eventually diagnosed as NF1 with growth hormone deficiency. A novel heterozygous splicing mutation c.6579+2 T>C (IVS 34+2 T>C) of NF1 gene was identified in the patient and his mother. Considering NF1 may present with short stature due to growth hormone deficiency, all children with short stature combined with cafe au lait spots should be screened for NF1, which may assist the clinical diagnosis and the genetic counseling.",30124220.txt,0
30878469,AGA Clinical Practice Update on Interaction Between Oral Direct-Acting Antivirals for Chronic Hepatitis C Infection and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Expert Review.,"DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this clinical practice update is to evaluate the evidence describing the interaction between direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with regard to HCC incidence, HCC recurrence, and DAA efficacy, and to summarize best practice advice regarding HCC surveillance and timing of DAA therapy. METHODS: The recommendations outlined in this expert review are based on available published evidence, including observational studies and systematic reviews, and incorporates expert opinion where applicable. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: DAA treatment is associated with a reduction in the risk of incident HCC. The relative risk reduction is similar in patients with and without cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis should receive surveillance imaging before initiating DAA treatment. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis at the time of DAA treatment represent the highest-risk group for HCC after DAA-induced sustained virologic response. These patients should stay in HCC surveillance. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: HCC surveillance should be performed using ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein every 6 months. Current data do not support shorter surveillance intervals or the use of alternative surveillance modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Future studies may show a reduction in HCC risk over time after DAA-induced sustained virologic response. However, in the interim, HCC surveillance should continue indefinitely if patients are otherwise eligible for potentially curative therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The presence of active HCC is associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in sustained virologic response with DAA therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Patients with HCC who are eligible for potentially curative therapy with liver resection or ablation should defer DAA therapy until after HCC treatment is completed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Timing of DAA therapy for patients with HCC who are listed for liver transplantation should be determined with consideration of median wait times, availability of hepatitis C virus-positive organs, and degree of liver dysfunction. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: There are insufficient data evaluating benefits and cost-effectiveness of DAA therapy in patients with active intermediate or advanced HCC. Decisions regarding DAA treatment in these patients should be considered in light of HCC tumor burden, degree of liver dysfunction, life expectancy, and patient preferences. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: There are no conclusive data that DAA therapy is associated with increased or decreased risk, differential time to recurrence, or aggressiveness of recurrent HCC in patients with complete response to HCC therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: DAA therapy should not be withheld from patients with complete response to HCC therapy; however, DAA therapy can be deferred 4-6 months to confirm response to HCC therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Patients with complete response to HCC therapy who are treated with DAAs have a continued risk of HCC recurrence and require HCC surveillance, which should be conducted indefinitely with dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging every 3-6 months. Current data do not support more frequent surveillance in these patients. This Clinical Practice Update was produced by the AGA Institute.",30878469.txt,1
31025086,Integrated diagnostics of diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas are the most common neuroepithelial tumors. Their classification is based on the integration of histological and molecular findings according to the classification of tumors of the central nervous system published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016. OBJECTIVES: This review describes the different entities and variants of diffuse gliomas and summarizes the current diagnostic criteria for these tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the 2016 WHO classification and selected other publications, the histomolecular diagnostics of diffuse gliomas is presented and illustrated. RESULTS: Diffuse gliomas are divided into isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant or IDH-wildtype gliomas by detection of mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes. Among the IDH-mutant gliomas, oligodendroglial tumors are characterized by combined losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q. Loss of nuclear expression of the ATRX protein is a marker of IDH- mutant astrocytic gliomas. Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, is the most common diffuse glioma. Diffuse and anaplastic astrocytic gliomas without IDH mutation should be further evaluated for molecular features of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Diffuse gliomas in the thalamus, brainstem, or spinal cord carrying a histone 3 (H3)-K27M mutation are classified as diffuse midline gliomas, H3-K27M-mutant. By determining the IDH and 1p/19q status, oligoastrocytomas can be stratified into either astrocytic or oligodendroglial gliomas. Gliomatosis cerebri is no longer regarded as a distinct glioma entity. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse gliomas can today be classified accurately and reproducibly by means of histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses.",31025086.txt,1
31127102,Atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of a native-like CENP-A nucleosome aided by an antibody fragment.,"Genomic DNA in eukaryotes is organized into chromatin through association with core histones to form nucleosomes, each distinguished by their DNA sequences and histone variants. Here, we used a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) derived from the anti-nucleosome antibody mAb PL2-6 to stabilize human CENP-A nucleosome containing a native alpha-satellite DNA and solved its structure by the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to 2.6 A resolution. In comparison, the corresponding cryo-EM structure of the free CENP-A nucleosome could only reach 3.4 A resolution. We find that scFv binds to a conserved acidic patch on the histone H2A-H2B dimer without perturbing the nucleosome structure. Our results provide an atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of a nucleosome and insight into the structure and function of the CENP-A nucleosome. The scFv approach is applicable to the structural determination of other native-like nucleosomes with distinct DNA sequences.",31127102.txt,0
31002019,Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma is associated with BRCA2 germline mutations: a case report and literature review.,"Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) is a rare pancreatic neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Insights into the molecular basis of ACC can pave the way for the application of more effective, personalized therapies and detection of patients with hereditary predisposition. Molecular analysis revealed a germline BRCA2 (and CHEK2) mutation in a patient with a rare pancreatic ACC with extensive intraductal growth. Somatic loss of the wild-type BRCA2 allele in the tumor indicated the causal relationship of ACC with the germline defect. A thorough literature review identified another nine ACCs associated with germline BRCA2 mutation and two ACCs associated with germline BRCA1 mutation, resulting in a prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline mutations in almost 7% of ACCs. Moreover, somatic BRCA1/2 alterations are reported in 16% of sporadic ACCs. Overall, about one fifth (22%) of all pancreatic ACCs exhibit BRCA1/2 deficiency. This study underscores the important role of BRCA1/2 mutations in pancreatic ACC. All ACC patients should undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2 mutations to identify carriers of pathogenic variants. This will allow to select patients that can benefit from targeted therapies directed against BRCA1/2-deficient tumors and is also crucial as a referral to genetic screening for the relatives of affected individuals carrying germline BRCA1/2 alterations. Abbreviations: ACC: acinar cell carcinoma; HBOC: Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer; LOH: loss of heterozygosity; PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; PDAC: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; PP: pancreatic panniculitis; SD: standard deviation; WES: whole-exome sequencing.",31002019.txt,1
36927529,Macrophage STING signaling promotes NK cell to suppress colorectal cancer liver metastasis via 4-1BBL/4-1BB co-stimulation.,"Macrophage innate immune response plays an important role in tumorigenesis. However, the role and mechanism of macrophage STING signaling in modulating tumor microenvironment to suppress tumor growth at secondary sites remains largely unclear.
STING expression was assessed in liver samples from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis. Global or myeloid stimulator of interferon gene (STING)-deficient mice, myeloid NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-deficient mice, and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to a mouse model of CRC liver metastasis by intrasplenic injection of murine colon carcinoma cells (MC38). Liver non-parenchymal cells including macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells were isolated for flow cytometry analysis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages pretreated with MC38 were co-cultured with splenic NK cells for in vitro studies.
Significant activation of STING signaling were detected in adjacent and tumor tissues and intrahepatic macrophages. Global or myeloid STING-deficient mice had exacerbated CRC liver metastasis and shorten survival, with decreased intrahepatic infiltration and impaired antitumor function of NK cells. Depletion of NK cells in WT animals increased their metastatic burden, while no significant effects were observed in myeloid STING-deficient mice. STING activation contributed to the secretion of interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1β by macrophages, which optimized antitumor activity of NK cells by promoting the expression of 4-1BBL in macrophages and 4-1BB in NK cells, respectively. Moreover, MC38 treatment activated macrophage NLRP3 signaling, which was inhibited by STING depletion. Myeloid NLRP3 deficiency increased tumor burden and suppressed activation of NK cells. NLRP3 activation by its agonist effectively suppressed CRC liver metastasis in myeloid SITNG-deficient mice.
We demonstrated that STING signaling promoted NLRP3-mediated IL-18 and IL-1β production of macrophages to optimize the antitumor function of NK cells via the co-stimulation signaling of 4-1BBL/4-1BB.",36927529.txt,1
29271416,Cryo-EM structure of human ATR-ATRIP complex.,"ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related) protein kinase and ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) form a complex and play a critical role in response to replication stress and DNA damage. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure of the human ATR-ATRIP complex at 4.7 A resolution and built an atomic model of the C-terminal catalytic core of ATR (residues 1 521-2 644) at 3.9 A resolution. The complex adopts a hollow ""heart"" shape, consisting of two ATR monomers in distinct conformations. The EM map for ATRIP reveals 14 HEAT repeats in an extended ""S"" shape. The conformational flexibility of ATR allows ATRIP to properly lock the N-termini of the two ATR monomers to favor ATR-ATRIP complex formation and functional diversity. The isolated ""head-head"" and ""tail-tail"" each adopts a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. The catalytic pockets face outward and substrate access is not restricted by inhibitory elements. Our studies provide a structural basis for understanding the assembly of the ATR-ATRIP complex and a framework for characterizing ATR-mediated DNA repair pathways.",29271416.txt,0
31538107,Malignant struma ovarii presenting with follicular carcinoma: A case report with molecular analysis.,"Malignant struma ovarii presenting with follicular carcinoma is extremely rare, and its mechanism of tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here, we present a case of malignant struma ovarii with peritoneal dissemination of follicular carcinoma, for which a molecular analysis for major oncogenic gene alterations in follicular thyroid carcinoma was performed. A 39-year-old nulliparous woman was referred with a diagnosis of highly differentiated follicular carcinoma of ovarian origin. Primary thyroid cancer was not diagnosed, and she had a normal thyroid function. 123I scintigraphy revealed multiple peritoneal dissemination that was surgically resected. Histologically, the tumor consisted of numerous follicles without nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Tumor samples were investigated for 50 cancer-related genes, including RAS, BRAF, and p53, and PPARg-PAX8 gene fusion by targeted DNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively. No major oncogenic gene alterations were detected. These negative findings suggest a different mechanism of tumorigenesis from that of adult-type follicular thyroid carcinoma.",31538107.txt,1
30937513,[Bronchoalveolar lavage in hairy cell leukemia with pulmonary infiltration].,"We report a 78-year-old male patient suffering from hairy cell leukemia, presenting clinically mainly with dyspnea. Radiology exhibited bilateral ground-glass shadows. In order to prevent pneumonia as a possible side effect due to conventional chemotherapy, it was decided to first treat the patient with rituximab; however, dyspnea persisted. Therefore, bronchoscopy was performed and specimens were sampled for both histological examination and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis. BAL showed lymphocytosis (28.7%), and by means of immunocytochemistry a few CD79a+ B-lymphocytes as well as lymphoid cells positive for the hairy cell marker DBA44 were observed. In addition, molecular study revealed the BRAF V600E mutation. Thus, the findings of BAL were interpreted as lung infiltration by hairy cell leukemia. This result was confirmed by histology. Following a therapy switch to cladribine, a significant improvement was reached. Pulmonary infiltrates by hairy cell leukemia were rarely described. This case represents the first report of hairy cell leukemia diagnosed by means of BAL. It may be difficult to clearly separate between lymphoma infiltration of the lung and medicamentous pneumonitis, but this differential diagnosis can be supported by morphological methods.",30937513.txt,1
30970592,Different Clinical Presentations and Management in Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS).,"Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder resulting from maternally inherited or de novo mutations involving the androgen receptor gene, situated in the Xq11-q12 region. The diagnosis is based on the presence of female external genitalia in a 46, XY human individual, with normally developed but undescended testes and complete unresponsiveness of target tissues to androgens. Subsequently, pelvic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be helpful in confirming the absence of Mullerian structures, revealing the presence of a blind-ending vagina and identifying testes. CAIS management still represents a unique challenge throughout childhood and adolescence, particularly regarding timing of gonadectomy, type of hormonal therapy, and psychological concerns. Indeed this condition is associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT), although TGCT results less frequently than in other disorders of sex development (DSD). Furthermore, the majority of detected tumoral lesions are non-invasive and with a low probability of progression into aggressive forms. Therefore, histological, epidemiological, and prognostic features of testicular cancer in CAIS allow postponing of the gonadectomy until after pubertal age in order to guarantee the initial spontaneous pubertal development and avoid the necessity of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) induction. However, HRT is necessary after gonadectomy in order to prevent symptoms of hypoestrogenism and to maintain secondary sexual features. This article presents differential clinical presentations and management in patients with CAIS to emphasize the continued importance of standardizing the clinical and surgical approach to this disorder.",30970592.txt,1
29712894,Increased proteasomal activity supports photoreceptor survival in inherited retinal degeneration.,"Inherited retinal degenerations, affecting more than 2 million people worldwide, are caused by mutations in over 200 genes. This suggests that the most efficient therapeutic strategies would be mutation independent, i.e., targeting common pathological conditions arising from many disease-causing mutations. Previous studies revealed that one such condition is an insufficiency of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to process misfolded or mistargeted proteins in affected photoreceptor cells. We now report that retinal degeneration in mice can be significantly delayed by increasing photoreceptor proteasomal activity. The largest effect is observed upon overexpression of the 11S proteasome cap subunit, PA28alpha, which enhanced ubiquitin-independent protein degradation in photoreceptors. Applying this strategy to mice bearing one copy of the P23H rhodopsin mutant, a mutation frequently encountered in human patients, quadruples the number of surviving photoreceptors in the inferior retina of 6-month-old mice. This striking therapeutic effect demonstrates that proteasomes are an attractive target for fighting inherited blindness.",29712894.txt,0
31321732,Chronic shisha exposure alters phosphoproteome of oral keratinocytes.,"Shisha smoking has been epidemiologically linked to oral cancer. However, few studies have investigated the pathobiology of shisha-induced cellular transformation. We studied the effects of chronic shisha exposure (8 months) in an in vitro model using immortalized, non-neoplastic oral keratinocytes (OKF6/TERT1). Quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses were performed on OKF6/TERT1 cells treated with shisha extract for a period of 8 months. Pathway analysis was carried out to identify significantly enriched biological processes in shisha-treated cells. Chronic shisha exposure resulted in increased cell scattering phenomenon in OKF6/TERT1 cells. Data analysis revealed differential phosphorylation of 164 peptides (fold change >=1.5, p <= 0.0.5) corresponding to 136 proteins. Proteins associated with mTORC1 and EIF4F complexes involved in initiating protein translation were seen to be enriched upon shisha treatment. Network analysis also highlighted downregulation of proteins involved in Type I interferon signaling in shisha-treated cells. Quantitative phosphoproteomic approach elucidated global perturbations to the molecular milieu of oral keratinocytes upon shisha exposure. Further studies are needed to validate putative targets in oral cancer patients with shisha smoking history.",31321732.txt,1
31197228,"Role of the DNA damage response in prostate cancer formation, progression and treatment.","BACKGROUND: Clinical and preclinical studies have revealed that alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways may play an important role in prostate cancer (PCa) etiology and progression. These alterations can influence PCa responses to radiotherapy and anti-androgen treatment. The identification of DNA repair gene aberrations in PCa has driven the interest for further evaluation whether these genetic changes may serve as biomarkers for patient stratification. METHODS: In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on DDR alterations in PCa, their potential impact on clinical interventions and prospects for improved management of PCa. We particularly focus on the influence of DDR gene mutations on PCa initiation and progression and describe the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of these mechanisms, will contribute to better disease management as treatment strategies can be chosen based on the specific disease properties, since a growing number of treatments are targeting DDR pathway alterations (such as Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors). Furthermore, the recently discovered crosstalk between the DDR and androgen receptor signaling opens a new array of possible strategies to optimize treatment combinations. We discuss how these recent and ongoing studies will help to improve diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches for PCa management.",31197228.txt,1
28146470,Rare and low-frequency coding variants alter human adult height.,"Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with approximately 700 common associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8%) and effects of up to 2 centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2 centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways.",28146470.txt,0
31348551,High incidence of MYC rearrangement in human immunodeficiency virus-positive plasmablastic lymphoma.,"AIMS: MYC rearrangements are the main cytogenetic alterations in plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). We aimed to investigate the relationship between MYC rearrangement and the clinicopathological features of PBL. METHODS AND RESULTS: MYC rearrangements assessed in 13 unpublished single-centre PBL cases, and an additional 85 cases from the literature, with reported MYC rearrangement information individualised by patient, were reviewed. In Asia, PBL was much less commonly diagnosed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients (27% versus 84%, P = 0.000), with older age (median age at diagnosis: 52 years versus 44 years, P = 0.046) and a lower EBV infection rate (56.8% versus 81.8%, P = 0.049), than in non-Asian regions. Overall, MYC rearrangements were identified in 44 of 98 (44.9%) PBL cases, and IGH was the partner in almost all available cases (30/31, 96.8%), as confirmed with a MYC-IGH fusion probe. The MYC rearrangement rate in HIV-positive cases (33/55, 60.0%) was significantly higher than that in HIV-negative cases (11/38, 28.9%, P = 0.003). Patients with MYC rearrangement showed a trend towards an inferior median survival time (9.6 months versus 15.7 months, P = 0.122) and 2-year overall survival (17% versus 32%, P = 0.238). CONCLUSIONS: MYC rearrangement was frequently identified in PBL patients, and IGH was the partner gene in an overwhelming majority of MYC rearrangements. In addition, the MYC rearrangement rate was significantly higher in HIV-positive PBL patients than that in HIV-negative patients. MYC rearrangement may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV-positive PBL, but further studies are required to understand the underlying mechanisms.",31348551.txt,1
25557241,Outcomes of preimplantation genetic diagnosis in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of patient and facility level factors on the success of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Large PGD reference laboratory. PATIENT(S): All patients with NF1 referred from June 2004 to May 2013. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryos' NF1 mutation status and live birth rates. RESULT(S): Seventy-seven couples underwent 156 PGD cycles during the study period. The average maternal age at the time of embryo biopsy was 33.2 years. The majority of embryos had a day 3 single blastomere biopsy without aneuploidy screening. A diagnosis was obtained for 80% of biopsied embryos; 20% of biopsies were nondiagnostic due to technical failures. Diagnosis was more often obtained for embryos of parents with familial disease and for embryos biopsied at centers that referred multiple NF1 cases. Among diagnosed embryos, 483/1,060 (46%) were unaffected by the parental NF1 mutation. Twenty-two (14%) of the 156 cycles had a confirmed live birth; if the observed success rate is applied to cycles with unknown outcomes, 33/156 (21%) cycles are expected to have resulted in live birth. In multivariate logistic regression, having a live birth was significantly associated with having more unaffected embryos available for transfer (odds ratio 1.33 per additional embryo, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.72). CONCLUSION(S): Advances in biopsy and diagnostic techniques which increase the number of unaffected embryos identified may improve live birth rates for patients with NF1. Clinicians should counsel patients about their fertility and reproductive options early, with the use of disease-specific data, to set appropriate expectations for the PGD process.",25557241.txt,0
25324352,Prospective blinded study of BRAFV600E mutation detection in cell-free DNA of patients with systemic histiocytic disorders.,"UNLABELLED: Patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) have a high frequency of BRAF(V600E) mutations and respond to RAF inhibitors. However, detection of mutations in tissue biopsies is particularly challenging in histiocytoses due to low tumor content and stromal contamination. We applied a droplet-digital PCR assay for quantitative detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in plasma and urine cell-free (cf) DNA and performed a prospective, blinded study in 30 patients with ECD/LCH. There was 100% concordance between tissue and urinary cfDNA genotype in treatment-naive samples. cfDNA analysis facilitated identification of previously undescribed KRAS(G12S)-mutant ECD and dynamically tracked disease burden in patients treated with a variety of therapies. These results indicate that cfDNA BRAF(V600E) mutational analysis in plasma and urine provides a convenient and reliable method of detecting mutational status and can serve as a noninvasive biomarker to monitor response to therapy in LCH and ECD. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant histiocytic disorders have remarkable responses to RAF inhibition, but mutation detection in tissue in these disorders is challenging. Here, we identify that analysis of plasma and urinary cfDNA provides a reliable method to detect the BRAF(V600E) mutation and monitor response to therapy in these disorders.",25324352.txt,0
36343306,"In Multiple Myeloma, High-Risk Secondary Genetic Events Observed at Relapse Are Present From Diagnosis in Tiny, Undetectable Subclonal Populations.","Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by copy number abnormalities (CNAs), some of which influence patient outcomes and are sometimes observed only at relapse(s), suggesting their acquisition during tumor evolution. However, the presence of micro-subclones may be missed in bulk analyses. Here, we use single-cell genomics to determine how often these high-risk events are missed at diagnosis and selected at relapse.
We analyzed 81 patients with plasma cell dyscrasias using single-cell CNA sequencing. Sixty-six patients were selected at diagnosis, nine at first relapse, and six in presymptomatic stages. A total of 956 newly diagnosed patients with MM and patients with first relapse MM have been identified retrospectively with required cytogenetic data to evaluate enrichment of CNA risk events and survival impact.
A total of 52,176 MM cells were analyzed. Seventy-four patients (91%) had 2-16 subclones. Among these patients, 28.7% had a subclone with high-risk features (del(17p), del(1p32), and 1q gain) at diagnosis. In a patient with a subclonal 1q gain at diagnosis, we analyzed the diagnosis, postinduction, and first relapse samples, which showed a rise of the high-risk 1q gain subclone (16%, 70%, and 92%, respectively). In our clinical database, we found that the 1q gain frequency increased from 30.2% at diagnosis to 43.6% at relapse (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.00). We subsequently performed survival analyses, which showed that the progression-free and overall survival curves were superimposable between patients who had the 1q gain from diagnosis and those who seemingly acquired it at relapse. This strongly suggests that many patients had 1q gains at diagnosis in microclones that were missed by bulk analyses.
These data suggest that identifying these scarce aggressive cells may necessitate more aggressive treatment as early as diagnosis to prevent them from becoming the dominant clone.",36343306.txt,1
36708875,P300 Interacted With N-Myc and Regulated Its Protein Stability via Altering Its Post-Translational Modifications in Neuroblastoma.,"MYCN amplification is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in neuroblastoma (NB), but its protein product cannot be directly targeted because of protein structure. Thus, this study aimed to explore novel ways to indirectly target N-Myc by regulating its post-translational modifications (PTMs) and therefore protein stability. N-Myc coimmunoprecipitation combined with HPLC-MS/MS identified 16 PTM residues and 114 potential N-Myc-interacting proteins. Notably, both acetylation and ubiquitination were identified on lysine 199 of N-Myc. We then discovered that p300, which can interact with N-Myc, modulated the protein stability of N-Myc in MYCN-amplified NB cell lines and simultaneously regulated the acetylation level and ubiquitination level on lysine-199 of N-Myc protein in vitro. Furthermore, p300 correlated with poor prognosis in NB patients. Taken together, p300 can be considered as a potential therapeutic target to treat MYCN-amplified NB patients, and other identified PTMs and interacting proteins also provide potential targets for further study.",36708875.txt,1
38650020,Meta-analysis of the global distribution of clinically relevant CYP2C8 alleles and their inferred functional consequences.,"CYP2C8 is responsible for the metabolism of 5% of clinically prescribed drugs, including antimalarials, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. Genetic variability is an important factor that influences CYP2C8 activity and modulates the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of its substrates.
We profiled the genetic landscape of CYP2C8 variability using data from 96 original studies and data repositories that included a total of 33,185 unrelated participants across 44 countries and 43 ethnic groups. The reduced function allele CYP2C8*2 was most common in West and Central Africa with frequencies of 16-36.9%, whereas it was rare in Europe and Asia (< 2%). In contrast, CYP2C8*3 and CYP2C8*4 were common throughout Europe and the Americas (6.9-19.8% for *3 and 2.3-7.5% for *4), but rare in African and East Asian populations. Importantly, we observe pronounced differences (> 2.3-fold) between neighboring countries and even between geographically overlapping populations. Overall, we found that 20-60% of individuals in Africa and Europe carry at least one CYP2C8 allele associated with reduced metabolism and increased adverse event risk of the anti-malarial amodiaquine. Furthermore, up to 60% of individuals of West African ancestry harbored variants that reduced the clearance of pioglitazone, repaglinide, paclitaxel and ibuprofen. In contrast, reduced function alleles are only found in < 2% of East Asian and 8.3-12.8% of South and West Asian individuals.
Combined, the presented analyses mapped the genetic and inferred functional variability of CYP2C8 with high ethnogeographic resolution. These results can serve as a valuable resource for CYP2C8 allele frequencies and distribution estimates of CYP2C8 phenotypes that could help identify populations at risk upon treatment with CYP2C8 substrates. The high variability between ethnic groups incentivizes high-resolution pharmacogenetic profiling to guide precision medicine and maximize its socioeconomic benefits, particularly for understudied populations with distinct genetic profiles.",38650020.txt,0
37909662,SMURF1 controls the PPP3/calcineurin complex and TFEB at a regulatory node for lysosomal biogenesis.,"Macroautophagy/autophagy is a homeostatic process in response to multiple signaling, such as the lysosome-dependent recycling process of cellular components. Starvation-induced MTOR inactivation and PPP3/calcineurin activation were shown to promote the nuclear translocation of TFEB. However, the mechanisms via which signals from endomembrane damage are transmitted to activate PPP3/calcineurin and orchestrate autophagic responses remain unknown. This study aimed to show that autophagy regulator SMURF1 controlled TFEB nuclear import for transcriptional activation of the lysosomal biogenesis. We showed that blocking SMURF1 affected lysosomal biogenesis in response to lysosomal damage by preventing TFEB nuclear translocation. It revealed galectins recognized endolysosomal damage, and led to recruitment of SMURF1 and the PPP3/calcineurin apparatus on lysosomes. SMURF1 interacts with both LGALS3 and PPP3CB to form the LGALS3-SMURF1-PPP3/calcineurin complex. Importantly, this complex further stabilizes TFEB, thereby activating TFEB for lysosomal biogenesis. We determined that LLOMe-mediated TFEB nuclear import is dependent on SMURF1 under the condition of MTORC1 inhibition. In addition, SMURF1 is required for PPP3/calcineurin activity as a positive regulator of TFEB. SMURF1 controlled the phosphatase activity of the PPP3CB by promoting the dissociation of its autoinhibitory domain (AID) from its catalytic domain (CD). Overexpression of SMURF1 showed similar effects as the constitutive activation of PPP3CB. Thus, SMURF1, which bridges environmental stress with the core autophagosomal and autolysosomal machinery, interacted with endomembrane sensor LGALS3 and phosphatase PPP3CB to control TFEB activation.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ATG: autophagy-related; LLOMe: L-Leucyl-L-Leucine methyl ester; ML-SA1: mucolipin synthetic agonist 1; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PPP3CB: protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit beta; RPS6KB1/p70S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; SMURF1: SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB.",37909662.txt,0
31304427,Pathology of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy and estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030. Although overall 5-year survival rates have constantly remained below 10% for the last decades, several key points important for accurate patient stratification have emerged during recent years. These key points include a highly standardized gross examination of PDAC resection specimens, using an axial slicing technique and inking of the circumferential resection margin (CRM), as well as a meticulous microscopic examination, taking into account the prognostic relevance of factors such as the exact resection status (R0 vs. R1 1-mm vs. R1 resection), histopathological tumor grading and the so-called lymph node ratio (LNR). With increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy in PDAC, tumor regression grading (TRG) for PDAC is currently rising in relevance in order to stratify and manage pre-operatively treated PDAC patients. As all current TRG systems for PDAC are unsatisfactory, new standardized international protocols are urgently needed. Several morphological subtypes of PDAC exist, some of which share the same molecular background with classical PDAC, while others are characterized by a distinct molecular pathogenesis. While some show a prognosis similar to classical PDAC, other subtypes stand out due to a better or even worse prognosis than classical PDAC. Prognostic relevant molecular subtypes of PDAC have been proposed as well, however, limitations of used cohorts and the lacking correlation of molecular subtypes with histomorphological subtypes limit the translation of these findings into valuable clinical applications. Lastly, several macroscopic and microscopic precursor lesions of PDAC have been described in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and humans in recent times, providing further insight into PDAC carcinogenesis. In addition, improved diagnosis of PDAC precursors represents a chance to select patients for resection before invasive PDAC is present.",31304427.txt,1
29357781,Dynamic dosing of romiplostim in patients with immune thrombocytopenia purpura: Two case reports.,"Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia purpura. When following FDA-approved romiplostim prescribing recommendations to withhold treatment for platelet counts above 400k/microL, some patients exhibit a precipitous decline in their platelet count potentially causing patient harm. We present two cases where stable platelet counts were achieved only through persistent weekly dosing of romiplostim despite platelet counts above 400k/microL on the day of administration. Therefore, continuous weekly dosing of romiplostim despite platelet count being above 400k/microL combined with twice weekly vigilant monitoring is an alternative method of romiplostim dosing that mitigates severe fluctuations in platelets. We also discuss important details, postulated mechanisms, and evidence-based mitigation strategies.",29357781.txt,0

Clinical presentation is variable, often based on the type of mastocytosis, but in all types of mastocytosis there seems to be an increase in the risk of anaphylaxis. Systemic mastocytosis is diagnosed based on bone marrow biopsy. Treatment is variable based on the type of mastocytosis, but trigger avoidance and anaphylaxis treatment are mainstays. There are no therapies that change the natural course of mastocytosis. For cutaneous mastocytosis, treatment is conservative and aimed at symptom relief.",27545739.txt,0
29915580,"CD8+HLADR+ Regulatory T Cells Change With Aging: They Increase in Number, but Lose Checkpoint Inhibitory Molecules and Suppressive Function.","CD4+ regulatory T cells have been intensively studied during aging, but little is still known about age-related changes of other regulatory T cell subsets. It was, therefore, the goal of the present study to analyze CD8+human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related (HLADR)+ T cells in old age, a cell population reported to have suppressive activity and to be connected to specific genetic variants. We demonstrate a strong increase in the number of CD8+HLADR+ T cells with age in a cohort of female Sardinians as well as in elderly male and female persons from Austria. We also show that CD8+HLADR+ T cells lack classical activation molecules, such as CD69 and CD25, but contain increased numbers of checkpoint inhibitory molecules, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3, LAG-3, and PD-1, when compared with their HLADR- counterparts. They also have the capacity to inhibit the proliferation of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This suppressive activity is, however, decreased when CD8+HLADR+ T cells from elderly persons are analyzed. In accordance with this finding, CD8+HLADR+ T cells from persons of old age contain lower percentages of checkpoint inhibitory molecules than young controls. We conclude that in spite of high abundance of a CD8+ regulatory T cell subset in old age its expression of checkpoint inhibitory molecules and its suppressive function on a per cell basis are reduced. Reduction of suppressive capacity may support uncontrolled subclinical inflammatory processes referred to as ""inflamm-aging.""",29915580.txt,0
30517645,"JUNO, the receptor of sperm IZUMO1, is expressed by the human oocyte and is essential for human fertilisation.","STUDY QUESTION: Is JUNO protein present at the surface membrane of human oocytes and involved in the fertilisation process? SUMMARY ANSWER: JUNO protein is expressed on the plasma membrane of human oocytes and its inhibition by a monoclonal antibody completely blocks gamete fusion. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fusion of gamete membranes is the culminating event of the fertilisation process, but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Until now, three molecules have been shown to be essential: CD9 tetraspanin in the oocyte, Izumo1 protein on the sperm and Juno, its corresponding receptor on the oocyte. Oocyte CD9 and sperm IZUMO1 have been identified in human gametes and their interaction is also well-conserved among several mammalian species. The presence of JUNO on human oocytes, however, has not yet been reported, nor has its role in fertilisation been investigated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We selected an anti-human JUNO antibody in order to investigate the presence of JUNO on the oocyte membrane surface and studied its potential involvement in gamete membrane interaction during fertilisation. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies against human JUNO (anti-hJUNO mAb) were produced by immunisation of mice with HEK cells transfected with the putative human JUNO sequence (HEK-hJUNO). These antibodies were used for immunostaining experiments and in vitro fertilisation assays with human gametes (GERMETHEQUE Biobank). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Three hybridoma supernatants, verified by immunostaining, revealed specifically HEK-hJUNO cells. The three purified monoclonal antibodies, FJ2E4 (IgG1), FJ8E8 (IgG1) and FJ4F5 (IgG2a), recognised the soluble recombinant human JUNO protein and, in a western blot of HEK-hJUNO extracts, a protein with an expected MW of 25 kDa. In addition, soluble recombinant human IZUMO protein inhibited the binding of anti-hJUNO mAbs to cells expressing hJUNO. Using these anti-hJUNO mAbs in immunostaining, we identified the presence of JUNO protein at the plasma membrane of human oocytes. Furthermore, we revealed a progressive expression of JUNO according to oocyte maturity. Finally, we showed that human zona-free oocytes, inseminated in the presence of anti-hJUNO mAb, were not fertilised by human sperm. These results suggest that, as seen in the mouse, JUNO is indeed involved in human gamete membrane fusion during fertilisation. LARGE-SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In accordance with French bioethics laws, functional tests were performed using zona-free oocytes, which of course does not fully encompass all normal in vivo physiological conditions. However, these in vitro tests do provide direct information regarding sperm-oocyte membrane interactions. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Mechanisms of gamete fusion appear to be homologous between mice and humans. However, some differences do exist and analysing the human mechanisms is essential. In fact, this is the first report describing the presence of JUNO on human oocytes and its involvement in human fertilisation. This discovery allows further examination of the understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive gamete fusion: a crucial challenge at a time when infertility affects 16% of reproductively active couples.

24522987,The impact of molecular testing on the surgical management of patients with thyroid nodules.,"BACKGROUND: The use of molecular tests as an adjunct to FNA diagnosis of thyroid nodules has been increasing. However, the true impact of these tests on surgical practice has not been demonstrated. This study examines the usefulness of molecular testing on surgical management decisions in patients referred for thyroid surgery at a tertiary care center. METHODS: Clinical information was collected from patients who presented to Johns Hopkins Hospital for surgical consultation regarding a thyroid nodule and who underwent molecular testing between August 2009 and March 2013. Tests included an RNA-based gene expression classifier, a DNA-based somatic mutation panel, BRAF, NRAS, and/or RET/PTC translocation. A surgical management algorithm was created by consensus of four thyroid surgeons. Postsurgical pathology analysis in each case was then used to judge the appropriateness of the surgical decision-making and the usefulness of preoperative molecular testing, in guiding surgical planning. RESULTS: Of 114 patients assessed by preoperative molecular testing, 87 (72 %) underwent surgery. Surgical management was altered in nine (10 %) patients on the basis of molecular testing. Of these, surgical management change was appropriate, relative to the postoperative pathology analysis, for three patients and inappropriate for six patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, molecular testing of thyroid nodule did not alter the surgical management of the majority of patients with thyroid nodules. These results indicate that molecular testing may be overused in patients for whom the results would not change surgical management. Furthermore, our data question the usefulness of the molecular tests examined in guiding preoperative surgical decision-making.",24522987.txt,0
24906339,"Tracking histone variant nucleosomes across the human cell cycle using biophysical, biochemical, and cytological analyses.","Histone variants such as H3.3, macroH2A, H2A.Z, and CENP-A are important epigenetic modifiers of the chromatin state in eukaryotic genomes. The centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A/CENH3 epigenetically marks centromeres and is required for assembly of the kinetochore complex, a region of the chromosome that is responsible for proper genome segregation during mitosis. Several diverse techniques using biochemical, cell biology, and biophysical approaches have been utilized to study the nature of the CENP-A nucleosome across the cell cycle. In this chapter, we describe methods for CENP-A nucleosome purification and separation of CENP-A from other core histones using traditional SDS-PAGE and more resolving techniques such as Triton acid urea (TAU) and two-dimensional gels. We also discuss methods for observation of CENP-A on chromatin fibers using immunofluorescence.

We present here the case of a 77-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a huge right renal mass on computed tomography. Radical nephrectomy was performed. Pathological diagnosis was MFH arising from the renal capsule. We used Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel version 2 primers to perform gene mutation screening.

31602010,Drug resistance in papillary RCC: from putative mechanisms to clinical practicalities.,"Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is the second most common renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype and accounts for 10-15% of all RCCs. Despite clinical need, few pharmacogenomics studies in pRCC have been performed. Moreover, current research fails to adequately include pRCC laboratory models, such as the ACHN or Caki-2 pRCC cell lines. The molecular mechanisms involved in pRCC development and drug resistance are more diverse than in clear-cell RCC, in which inactivation of VHL occurs in the majority of tumours. Drug resistance to multiple therapies in pRCC occurs via genetic alteration (such as mutations resulting in abnormal receptor tyrosine kinase activation or RALBP1 inhibition), dysregulation of signalling pathways (such as GSK3beta-EIF4EBP1, PI3K-AKT and the MAPK or interleukin signalling pathways), deregulation of cellular processes (such as resistance to apoptosis or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) and interactions between the cell and its environment (for example, through activation of matrix metalloproteinases). Improved understanding of resistance mechanisms will facilitate drug discovery and provide new effective therapies. Further studies on novel resistance biomarkers are needed to improve patient prognosis and stratification as well as drug development.",31602010.txt,1
36941031,Genome-wide association study identifies genetic variants which predict the response of bone mineral density to teriparatide therapy.,"Teriparatide (TPTD) is an effective treatment for osteoporosis but the individual response to therapy is variable for reasons that are unclear. This study aimed to determine whether the response to TPTD might be influenced by genetic factors.
We searched for predictors of the response of bone mineral density (BMD) to TPTD using a two-stage genome-wide association study in 437 patients with osteoporosis from three referral centres. Demographic and clinical data including the response of BMD to treatment at the lumbar spine and hip were extracted from the medical records of each participant.
Allelic variation at rs6430612 on chromosome 2, close <i>to the CXCR4</i> gene was associated with the response of spine BMD to TPTD at a genome wide significant level (p=9.2×10<sup>-9</sup> beta=-0.35 (-0.47 to -0.23)). The increase in BMD was almost twice as great in AA homozygotes at rs6430612 as compared with GG homozygotes with intermediate values in heterozygotes. The same variant was also associated with response of femoral neck and total hip BMD (p=0.007). An additional locus on chromosome 19 tagged by rs73056959 was associated with the response of femoral neck BMD to TPTD (p=3.5×10<sup>-9</sup>, beta=-1.61 (-2.14 to -1.07)).
Genetic factors influence the response to TPTD at the lumbar spine and hip with a magnitude of effect that is clinically relevant. Further studies are required to identify the causal genetic variants and underlying mechanisms as well as to explore how genetic testing for these variants might be implemented in clinical practice.",36941031.txt,0
31167998,[Acute myeloid leukemia evolving from KIT D816-mutated systemic mastocytosis relapsing two months after completion of chemotherapy].,"Here, we report the case of a 9-year-old girl with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) developed from systemic mastocytosis (SM). She experienced bladder and rectal disturbance due to an extramedullary nodule in the paraspinal region of the sacrum. Cytogenetic and genetic analyses of leukemic cells revealed the KIT D816Y mutation besides t (8;21) (q22:q22) /RUNX1-RUNX1T1. Despite receiving proton beam therapy after conventional chemotherapy, the patient relapsed after 2 months. As SM-AML with the KIT D816 mutation in adults exhibits a poor prognosis, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended. Owing to a few reports of SM-AML in children, the standard therapy for pediatric cases has not been established to date. Based on our experience and the related literature, the prognosis of childhood SM-AML could be as poor as in adults. Hence, further investigation, including mutational analyses of the KIT gene, is warranted to establish a risk-oriented strategy for managing childhood SM-AML.",31167998.txt,1
31385070,Sarcoma with MGA-NUTM1 fusion in the lung: an emerging entity.,"We here document a sarcoma with a recently reported MGA-NUTM1 fusion. A 49-year-old man presented with a nodule in the right lung, which grew to a giant mass in 5 years. The tumor showed uniform oval to spindle cell proliferation in a hypervascular stroma, associated with focal myxoid change and peculiar collagen deposition resembling an osteoid. The tumor showed an undifferentiated phenotype, including negativity for cytokeratin, although it was immunoreactive to BCOR and MUC4, and was initially suspected as BCOR-associated sarcoma. After complete resection, the tumor recurred in the mediastinal lymph node, and the patient died of the disease. RNA sequencing detected MGA (exon 22)-NUTM1 (exon 3), which was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and NUT immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathological features of the present case were similar to some of the reported cases of MGA-NUTM1 sarcomas, suggesting the emergence of a distinct tumor subtype.",31385070.txt,1
30651914,Aneurysmal bone cyst of the frontal bone - A radiologic-pathologic correlation.,"We present a case of 27-year-old female who presented for a progressive frontal swelling with ipsilateral headache. Subsequent CT scan revealed an extradural and expansile multiloculated mass with thin and strongly enhanced septations and MRI evaluation showed internal hyperintensity on T2 with no restriction of diffusion and confirmed the multiple cystic spaces with enhancing septations and rare hemorrhagic fluid-fluid levels. Surgery was performed and diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst was made on frozen section. Identification of USP6 fusion gene by in situ hybridization technique permitted to confirm the diagnosis of primary ABC. Although aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) of the skull is a very rare entity and accounts for 2-6% of all ABCs, we should think about it in front of osteolytic and cystic skull changes even with very few fluid-fluid levels. Following description of our case and differential diagnoses, we conduct a literature review of skull ABCs imaging characteristics and discuss the interest of USP6 rearrangement identification.",30651914.txt,0
38189053,Causal association of immune cells and polycystic ovarian syndrome: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disorder that affects a considerable number of women worldwide. It is accompanied by irregular menstruation, hyperandrogenism, metabolic abnormalities, reproductive disorders and other clinical symptoms, which seriously endangers women's physical and mental health. The etiology and pathogenesis of PCOS are not completely clear, but it is hypothesized that immune system may play a key role in it. However, previous studies investigating the connection between immune cells and PCOS have produced conflicting results.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful study design that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to enable examination of the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in observational data. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive two-sample MR analysis to examine the causal link between 731 immune cells and PCOS. We employed complementary MR methods, such as the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, and conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the reliability of the outcomes.
Four immunophenotypes were identified to be significantly associated with PCOS risk: Memory B cell AC (IVW: OR [95%]: 1.123[1.040 to 1.213], <i>p</i> = 0.003), CD39+ CD4+ %CD4+ (IVW: OR [95%]: 0.869[0.784 to 0.963], <i>p</i> = 0.008), CD20 on CD20- CD38-(IVW: OR [95%]:1.297[1.088 to 1.546], <i>p</i> = 0.004), and HLA DR on CD14- CD16+ monocyte (IVW: OR [95%]:1.225[1.074 to 1.397], <i>p</i> = 0.003). The results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings.
Our MR analysis provides strong evidence supporting a causal association between immune cells and the susceptibility of PCOS.

31189917,Feedback inhibition of cAMP effector signaling by a chaperone-assisted ubiquitin system.,"Activation of G-protein coupled receptors elevates cAMP levels promoting dissociation of protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzymes and release of catalytic subunits (PKAc). This results in PKAc-mediated phosphorylation of compartmentalized substrates that control central aspects of cell physiology. The mechanism of PKAc activation and signaling have been largely characterized. However, the modes of PKAc inactivation by regulated proteolysis were unknown. Here, we identify a regulatory mechanism that precisely tunes PKAc stability and downstream signaling. Following agonist stimulation, the recruitment of the chaperone-bound E3 ligase CHIP promotes ubiquitylation and proteolysis of PKAc, thus attenuating cAMP signaling. Genetic inactivation of CHIP or pharmacological inhibition of HSP70 enhances PKAc signaling and sustains hippocampal long-term potentiation. Interestingly, primary fibroblasts from autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 16 (SCAR16) patients carrying germline inactivating mutations of CHIP show a dramatic dysregulation of PKA signaling. This suggests the existence of a negative feedback mechanism for restricting hormonally controlled PKA activities.",31189917.txt,0
36752347,AD-Syn-Net: systematic identification of Alzheimer's disease-associated mutation and co-mutation vulnerabilities via deep learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most challenging neurodegenerative diseases because of its complicated and progressive mechanisms, and multiple risk factors. Increasing research evidence demonstrates that genetics may be a key factor responsible for the occurrence of the disease. Although previous reports identified quite a few AD-associated genes, they were mostly limited owing to patient sample size and selection bias. There is a lack of comprehensive research aimed to identify AD-associated risk mutations systematically. To address this challenge, we hereby construct a large-scale AD mutation and co-mutation framework ('AD-Syn-Net'), and propose deep learning models named Deep-SMCI and Deep-CMCI configured with fully connected layers that are capable of predicting cognitive impairment of subjects effectively based on genetic mutation and co-mutation profiles. Next, we apply the customized frameworks to data sets to evaluate the importance scores of the mutations and identified mutation effectors and co-mutation combination vulnerabilities contributing to cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of mutation pairs on the network architecture to dissect the genetic organization of AD and identify novel co-mutations that could be responsible for dementia, laying a solid foundation for proposing future targeted therapy for AD precision medicine.

30980196,"Molecular carcinogenesis of gastric cancer: Lauren classification, mucin phenotype expression, and cancer stem cells.","Gastric cancer (GC), one of the most common human cancers, is a heterogeneous disease with different phenotypes, prognoses, and responses to treatment. Understanding the pathogenesis of GC at the molecular level is important for prognosis prediction and determining treatments. Microsatellite instability (MSI), silencing of MLH1, MGMT, and CDKN2A genes by DNA hypermethylation, KRAS mutation, APC mutation, and ERBB2 amplification are frequently found in intestinal type GC. Inactivation of CDH1 and RARB by DNA hypermethylation, and amplification of FGFR and MET, are frequently detected in diffuse type GC. In addition, BST2 and PCDHB9 genes are overexpressed in intestinal type GC. Both genes are associated with GC progression. GC can be divided into gastric/intestinal mucin phenotypes according to mucin expression. MSI, alterations of TP73, CDH1 mutation, and DNA methylation of MLH are detected frequently in the gastric mucin phenotype. TP53 mutation, deletion of APC, and DNA methylation of MGMT are detected frequently in the intestinal mucin phenotype. FKTN is overexpressed in the intestinal mucin phenotype, and IQGAP3 is overexpressed in the gastric mucin phenotype. These genes are involved in GC progression. To characterize cancer stem cells, a useful method is spheroid colony formation. KIFC1 and KIF11 genes show more than twofold higher expression in spheroid-forming cells than that in parental cells. Both KIF genes are overexpressed in GC, and knockdown of these genes inhibits spheroid formation. Alterations of these molecules may be useful to understand gastric carcinogenesis. Specific inhibitors of these molecules may also be promising anticancer drugs.",30980196.txt,1

Adeno-associated virus vectors are attractive for clinical use because (1) adeno-associated viruses do not cause human disease and (2) these vectors are able to persist for years. New vectors are now becoming available as gene therapy delivery tools, and recent preclinical experiments have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of gene therapy with adeno-associated virus for long-term correction of muscle pathology and weakness in myotubularin-deficient canine and murine disease models. In this review, recent advances in the application of gene therapies to treat inherited muscle disorders are presented, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy and x-linked myotubular myopathy.

25612910,Evaluation of somatic mutations in tibial pseudarthrosis samples in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"BACKGROUND: Tibial pseudarthrosis is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and there is wide clinical variability of the tibial dysplasia in NF1, suggesting the possibility of genetic modifiers. Double inactivation of NF1 is postulated to be necessary for the development of tibial pseudarthrosis, but tissue or cell of origin of the 'second hit' mutation remains unclear. METHODS: Exome sequencing of different sections of surgically resected NF1 tibial pseudarthrosis tissue was performed and compared to germline (peripheral blood). RESULTS: A germline NF1 splice site mutation (c.61-2A>T, p.L21 M68del) was identified from DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Exome sequencing of DNA extracted from tissue removed during surgery of the tibial pseudarthrosis showed a somatic mutation of NF1 (c.3574G>T, p.E1192*) in the normal germline allele. Further analysis of different regions of the tibial pseudarthrosis sample showed enrichment of the somatic mutation in the soft tissue within the pseudarthrosis site and absence of the somatic mutation in cortical bone. In addition, a germline variant in PTPN11 (c.1658C>T, p.T553M), a gene involved in the RAS signal transduction pathway was identified, although the clinical significance is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the NF1 somatic mutation was primarily detected in the proliferative soft tissue at the pseudarthrosis site, it is likely that the second hit occurred in mesenchymal progenitors from the periosteum. These results are consistent with a defect of differentiation, which may explain why the mutation is found in proliferative cells and not within cortical bone tissue, as the latter by definition contains mostly mature differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes.",25612910.txt,0

38193064,Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia post COVID-19 booster vaccination in Brazil: a case series.,"The emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the administration of different booster vaccines to mitigate COVID-19. Vaccines with adenoviral vectors have been rarely associated with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).
This study aimed to describe 15 cases of VITT after the third and fourth doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil.
Cases were reported after all kinds of anti-SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccinations between October 17, 2021, and September 4, 2022.
Of the 26 suspected cases, 15 cases of VITT were analyzed. Of these, 10 were classified as definite VITT, 2 as probable, 1 as possible, and 2 as unlikely. The estimated frequency of definite, probable, or possible VITT was 0.33 cases per million. Cases were assigned to ChAdOx1 (13 cases), Ad26.COV2.S (1 case), and BNT162b2 (1 case). None of the patients received an adenoviral vaccine as a primary vaccination. The average age of participants was 34 years, and symptoms usually appeared 8 days after vaccination. Headache was the most common symptom, and cerebral veins were the most affected thrombotic site. The overall mortality risk was 53%. Anti-platelet factor 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology was positive in 11 out of 15 patients (73.3%), negative in 2 (13.3%), and missing in 2 (13.3%).
The study confirms that VITT is linked to the first exposure to adenoviral vector vaccines. Since January 2023, Brazil has recommended preferably COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines for individuals aged 18 to 39 years. We suggest that, in the current disease scenario, COVID-19 adenovirus vaccines should not be the first choice for individuals aged <50 years who have not received a previous dose of this type of vaccine.",38193064.txt,0

To better understand how chromatin regulates AGSC biology and gametogenesis, we derived stage-specific high-resolution profiles of DNA methylation, 5hmC, histone modifications/variants, and RNA-seq in AGSCs and during spermatogenesis. First, we define striking signaling and transcriptional differences between AGSC types, involving key self-renewal and proliferation pathways. Second, key pluripotency factors (e.g., Nanog) are silent in AGSCs and bear particular chromatin/DNAme attributes that may ""poise"" them for reactivation after fertilization. Third, AGSCs display chromatin ""poising/bivalency"" of enhancers and promoters for embryonic transcription factors. Remarkably, gametogenesis occurs without significant changes in DNAme and instead involves transcription of DNA-methylated promoters bearing high RNAPol2, H3K9ac, H3K4me3, low CG content, and (often) 5hmC. Furthermore, key findings were confirmed in human sperm. Here, we reveal AGSC signaling asymmetries and chromatin/DNAme strategies in AGSCs to poise key transcription factors and to activate DNA-methylated promoters during gametogenesis.",24835570.txt,0
36779536,BRAF V600E and RNF43 Co-mutations Predict Patient Outcomes With Targeted Therapies in Real-World Cases of Colorectal Cancer.,"Anti-BRAF/EGFR therapy is approved for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with BRAFV600E mutations, although not all patients respond. Novel recent findings indicate the potential of RNF43 mutations to predict outcomes in patients with BRAF-mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) mCRC treated with anti-BRAF/EGFR therapy. This study aimed to independently and rapidly validate BRAFV600E/RNF43 co-mutations as predictive biomarkers of benefit to anti-EGFR/BRAF therapy. Clinical data were derived from electronic health record data from ~280 US cancer clinics between January 2011 and March 2022 from the Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine real-world clinico-genomic mCRC database. Real-world cases of BRAFV600E-mutated mCRC, with patients receiving anti-BRAF/EGFR therapy (n = 49), were included. Patients who were MSS, with RNF43 mutations, had favorable progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.29; 95% CI [CI], 0.13-0.65) and overall survival (HR 0.32, 95% CI, 0.12-0.84) compared with wild type. No difference in outcomes was observed between patient groups with RNF43-mutant versus wild-type receiving standard-of-care chemotherapy. BRAFV600E/RNF43 co-mutations predict mCRC anti-BRAF/EGFR outcomes in diverse clinical settings.",36779536.txt,1
29171770,Emerging biomarkers of lymphangioleiomyomatosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a destructive lung disease affecting primarily women. LAM is caused by inactivating mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes, resulting in hyperactivation of mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Over the past five years, there have been remarkable advances in the diagnosis and therapy of LAM, including the identification of vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) as a diagnostic biomarker and the US Food and Drug Administration approval of sirolimus as therapy for LAM. In appropriate clinical situations VEGF-D testing can make lung biopsy unnecessary to diagnose LAM. However, there remains an urgent unmet need for additional biomarkers of disease activity and/or response to therapy. Areas covered: This work reviews VEGF-D, an established LAM biomarker, and discusses emerging biomarkers, including circulating LAM cells, imaging, lipid, and metabolite biomarkers, focusing on those with the highest potential impact for LAM patients. Expert commentary: Ongoing research priorities include the development of validated biomarkers to 1) noninvasively diagnose LAM in women whose VEGF-D levels are not diagnostic, 2) accurately predict the likelihood of disease progression and 3) quantitatively measure disease activity and LAM cell burden. These biomarkers would enable personalized, precision clinical care and fast-track clinical trial implementation, with high clinical impact.",29171770.txt,0
31558473,Analysis of Biomarkers and Association With Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Subanalysis of the Sorafenib Phase III DECISION Trial.,"PURPOSE: The phase III DECISION trial (NCT00984282; EudraCT:2009-012007-25) established sorafenib efficacy in locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) refractory to radioactive iodine. We conducted a retrospective, exploratory biomarker analysis of patients from DECISION. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Candidate biomarkers [15 baseline plasma proteins, baseline and during-treatment serum thyroglobulin, and relevant tumor mutations (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS)] were analyzed for correlation with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Plasma biomarker and thyroglobulin data were available for 395 of 417 (94.7%) and 403 of 417 (96.6%) patients, respectively. Elevated baseline VEGFA was independently associated with poor prognosis for progression-free survival [PFS; HR = 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-2.44; P = 0.0007], overall survival (HR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.37-3.36; P = 0.013), and disease-control rate (DCR; OR = 0.30; P = 0.009). Elevated baseline thyroglobulin was independently associated with poor PFS (HR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.52-2.71; P < 0.0001) and DCR (OR = 0.32; P = 0.01). Combined VEGFA/thyroglobulin signatures correlated with poor PFS (HR = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.57-2.87; P < 0.00001). Thyroglobulin decrease >=30% from baseline was achieved by 76% and 14% of patients receiving sorafenib and placebo, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients with >=30% thyroglobulin reduction had longer PFS than those without >=30% reduction [HR (95% CI): sorafenib = 0.61 (0.40-0.94), P = 0.022; placebo = 0.49 (0.29-0.85), P = 0.009]. BRAF mutations were associated with better PFS; RAS mutations were associated with worse PFS, although neither was independently prognostic in multivariate models. No examined biomarker predicted sorafenib benefit. CONCLUSIONS: We identified biomarkers associated with poor prognosis in DTC, including elevated baseline VEGFA and thyroglobulin and the presence of RAS mutations. Serum thyroglobulin may be a biomarker of tumor response and progression.",31558473.txt,1
26276780,Morphologically occult systemic mastocytosis in bone marrow: clinicopathologic features and an algorithmic approach to diagnosis.,"OBJECTIVES: Bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens involved by systemic mastocytosis (SM) typically show multifocal, compact, dense aggregates of spindled mast cells (MCs). However, some cases lack aggregate formation and fulfill the World Health Organization 2008 criteria for SM, based on minor criteria. METHODS: We identified 26 BM cases of KIT D816V-mutated, morphologically occult SM in the BM. RESULTS: All patients had some combination of allergic/MC activating symptoms. Peripheral blood counts were generally normal. BM aspirates showed 5% or less MCs, which were only occasionally spindled. BM biopsy specimens showed no morphologic classic MC lesions. Tryptase immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated interstitial, individually distributed MCs (up to 5%) with prominent spindling, lacking aggregate formation. MCs coexpressed CD25 by IHC and/or flow cytometry. Spindled MCs constituted more than 25% of total MCs in all cases and more than 50% in 20 of 26 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Morphologically occult involvement of normal-appearing BM by SM will be missed without appropriate clinical suspicion and pathologic evaluation by tryptase and CD25 IHC and KIT D816V mutation analysis. On the basis of these findings, we propose a cost-effective, data-driven, evidence-based algorithmic approach to the workup of these cases.",26276780.txt,0
30880225,A comprehensive study of epigenetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma identifies potential therapeutic targets.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: A causal link has recently been established between epigenetic alterations and hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating that epigenetic inhibition may have therapeutic potential. We aimed to identify and target epigenetic modifiers that show molecular alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We studied the molecular-clinical correlations of epigenetic modifiers including bromodomains, histone acetyltransferases, lysine methyltransferases and lysine demethylases in HCC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data of 365 patients with HCC. The therapeutic potential of epigenetic inhibitors was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing analysis and its correlation with expression and clinical data in the TCGA dataset were used to identify expression programs normalized by Jumonji lysine demethylase (JmjC) inhibitors. RESULTS: Genetic alterations, aberrant expression, and correlation between tumor expression and poor patient prognosis of epigenetic enzymes are common events in HCC. Epigenetic inhibitors that target bromodomain (JQ-1), lysine methyltransferases (BIX-1294 and LLY-507) and JmjC lysine demethylases (JIB-04, GSK-J4 and SD-70) reduce HCC aggressiveness. The pan-JmjC inhibitor JIB-04 had a potent antitumor effect in tumor bearing mice. HCC cells treated with JmjC inhibitors showed overlapping changes in expression programs related with inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death. JmjC inhibition reverses an aggressive HCC gene expression program that is also altered in patients with HCC. Several genes downregulated by JmjC inhibitors are highly expressed in tumor vs. non-tumor parenchyma, and their high expression correlates with a poor prognosis. We identified and validated a 4-gene expression prognostic signature consisting of CENPA, KIF20A, PLK1, and NCAPG. CONCLUSIONS: The epigenetic alterations identified in HCC can be used to predict prognosis and to define a subgroup of high-risk patients that would potentially benefit from JmjC inhibitor therapy. LAY SUMMARY: In this study, we found that mutations and changes in expression of epigenetic modifiers are common events in human hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to an aggressive gene expression program and poor clinical prognosis. The transcriptional program can be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of Jumonji enzymes. This inhibition blocks hepatocellular carcinoma progression, providing a novel potential therapeutic strategy.",30880225.txt,1
27651169,Gene panel sequencing improves the diagnostic work-up of patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis and identifies new mutations.,"Erythrocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by increased red cell mass and elevated hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. Several genetic variants have been identified as causes for erythrocytosis in genes belonging to different pathways including oxygen sensing, erythropoiesis and oxygen transport. However, despite clinical investigation and screening for these mutations, the cause of disease cannot be found in a considerable number of patients, who are classified as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. In this study, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing panel encompassing the exonic regions of 21 genes from relevant pathways (~79 Kb) and sequenced 125 patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis. The panel effectively screened 97% of coding regions of these genes, with an average coverage of 450x. It identified 51 different rare variants, all leading to alterations of protein sequence, with 57 out of 125 cases (45.6%) having at least one of these variants. Ten of these were known erythrocytosis-causing variants, which had been missed following existing diagnostic algorithms. Twenty-two were novel variants in erythrocytosis-associated genes (EGLN1, EPAS1, VHL, BPGM, JAK2, SH2B3) and in novel genes included in the panel (e.g. EPO, EGLN2, HIF3A, OS9), some with a high likelihood of functionality, for which future segregation, functional and replication studies will be useful to provide further evidence for causality. The rest were classified as polymorphisms. Overall, these results demonstrate the benefits of using a gene panel rather than existing methods in which focused genetic screening is performed depending on biochemical measurements: the gene panel improves diagnostic accuracy and provides the opportunity for discovery of novel variants.",27651169.txt,0
26471738,Evaluation of romiplostim for the treatment of secondary failure of platelet recovery among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.,"Secondary failure of platelet recovery (SFPR) is a serious complication observed in approximately 20% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Although the standard therapeutic approach has been frequent platelet transfusions, romiplostim, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, may have utility in treating SFPR. The primary objective of this single-center retrospective analysis was to assess effectiveness of romiplostim for SFPR and to evaluate patient factors which may influence clinical outcomes. The primary outcome measure of response was defined as achievement of platelet count >= 50 x 109/L without transfusions for >= 7 consecutive days. During the study period, 93 patients underwent HSCT and 13 (13.9%) received romiplostim for SFPR. Seven patients (53.8%) responded to romiplostim, requiring a median of three doses (range 1-6) to achieve independence from platelet transfusions. Disease relapse occurred in 38.5% of all patients, two responders and three nonresponders. Median survival post-HSCT was 753 days among responders and 266 days among nonresponders ( p = 0.0375). No serious adverse events were reported, and rates of graft-versus-host disease did not increase following administration of romiplostim. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists including romiplostim offer a treatment option for persistent thrombocytopenia following HSCT. Positive clinical response to romiplostim post-HSCT is associated with improved outcomes.",26471738.txt,0
31427547,Androgen receptor expression in triple negative breast carcinoma and its association with the clinicopathological parameters.,"INTRODUCTION: Androgen receptor (AR) is the most frequently expressed biomarker in all subtypes of breast carcinoma. Triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) is breast carcinoma that lacks oestrogen and progesterone receptors immunoexpression as well as absence of HER2/neu gene amplification. This makes targeted therapy not feasible in this cancer and hence has poorer prognosis. Detecting AR expression could be another milestone in the management of TNBC, as AR is a prognostic, predictive marker and potential index for targeted treatment. This study aimed to assess expression of AR in TNBC by immunohistochemistry and its association with clinicopathological parameters. METHODS: We analysed the expression of AR in 97 TNBC cases from Penang General Hospital for a period of 3 years (2014 to 2017). Androgen receptor immunoreactivity was considered positive if >= 1% of tumour cells nuclei were stained irrespective of staining intensity. RESULTS: The prevalence of AR expression in TNBC was 31% (30/97), with the proportion of AR-positive tumour cells ranged from 1% to 90%. These include 23 invasive carcinomas, no special type (NST) and 7 other invasive carcinoma subtypes (papillary, lobular, clear cell and medullary carcinomas). Sixty-seven cases (69%) that showed AR immunonegativity were invasive carcinomas, NST (n=60), clear cell carcinoma (n=1) and metaplastic carcinoma (n=6). Androgen receptor immunoexpression was inversely correlated with tumour grade (p=0.016), but not the tumour stage, tumour size and nodal status. CONCLUSION: AR is expressed in about one-third of TNBC and loss of AR immunoexpression does not predict adverse clinical outcomes. Larger cohorts for better characterisation of the role of AR immunoexpression in TNBC are warranted.",31427547.txt,1
30818012,"Mucus penetrating properties of soft, distensible lipid nanocapsules.","Designing nanomaterials to release their drug pay-load upon exposure to an exogenous trigger can help to direct drug delivery, but how the triggered release, which often modifies the nanomaterial properties, influences the biological fate of these systems is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate how the triggered drug release from PEG coated, soft, 50 nm distensible lipid nanocapsules (LNC) influenced their diffusion across a mucus barrier. The translocation speed of the non-triggered LNC across a 35 microm thick purified gastric mucin (PGM) barrier was 3 times faster (30.08 +- 2.49 x 10-10 cm2 s-1) compared to equivalent-sized negatively charged polystyrene particles (9.87 +- 0.61 x 10-10 cm2 s-1, p < 0.05). In cystic fibrosis mucus (CFM), harvested from patient primary cells, the non-triggered LNC translocation speed was similar to the PGM, but the polystyrene particle diffusion was so slow it could not be measured. The trigger induced LNC distension process had no effect on the particle diffusion rate in both PGM and CFM (p > 0.05) in a static mucus barrier, but when shear was applied to the barrier the distended LNCs diffused more slowly (3.97 +- 1.38 x 10-8 cm2 s-1, p < 0.05) compared to the non-distended materials (4.94 +- 0.04 x 10-8 cm2 s-1). This data suggested the rapid mucus penetration of the distended LNCs, despite their increased size, was a consequence of their capacity to take a less tortuous path through the barrier, i.e., they experienced less steric hinderance, compared to the non-distended LNC.",30818012.txt,0
31268928,Melanotic Schwannoma of the Vulva: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Melanotic schwannoma is a pigmented tumor of peripheral nerve differentiation. Primary cutaneous presentations are extremely rare, as the bulk of melanotic schwannomas tend to develop in paraspinal and axial sites. Tumors arise sporadically and in the setting of the Carney complex. Alterations in the gene encoding protein kinase A regulatory subunit-alpha (PRKAR1A) underlie most patients with the Carney complex and mediate melanotic schwannoma tumorigenesis. Melanotic schwannomas from noncutaneous sites can locally recur and metastasize widely, leading to a recent proposal to change the nomenclature to ""malignant melanotic schwannian tumor."" However, the clinicopathologic features of primary cutaneous melanotic schwannomas are relatively unexplored. We present a case of a nodule arising on the vulva of a 34-year-old woman. Microscopically, a dermal-based, heavily pigmented proliferation of plump spindled and epithelioid cells arrayed in nodules and fascicles was seen. Lesional cells stained positively for S100, Melan-A, and BAP1 but were negative for Prkar1alpha. Next-generation sequencing of a panel of 480 cancer-associated genes revealed that the tumor harbored a PRKAR1A p.S299fs truncating mutation and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 17q, the locus at which PRKAR1A resides. Importantly, no other genetic abnormalities or chromosomal copy number changes were identified. On the basis of combined histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features, a diagnosis of melanotic schwannoma was rendered. Overall, we present the first clinicopathologic description of a vulvar melanotic schwannoma, review the literature concerning cutaneous presentations of melanotic schwannoma, and propose that melanotic schwannian tumors native to skin may behave more indolently than their noncutaneous counterparts.",31268928.txt,1
31241739,Establishment of permutation for cancer risk estimation in the urothelium based on genome-wide DNA methylation analysis.,"The aim of this study was to establish permutation for cancer risk estimation in the urothelium. Twenty-six samples of normal control urothelium obtained from patients without urothelial carcinomas (C), 47 samples of non-cancerous urothelium without noticeable morphological changes obtained from patients with urothelial carcinomas (N), and 46 samples of the corresponding cancerous tissue (T) in the learning cohort and 64 N samples in the validation cohort, i.e. 183 tissue samples in total, were analyzed. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip, and DNA methylation levels were verified using pyrosequencing and MassARRAY. Amplicon sequencing was performed using the GeneRead DNAseq Targeted Panels V2. Although N samples rarely showed genetic mutations or copy number alterations, they showed DNA methylation alterations at 2502 CpG sites compared to C samples, and such alterations were inherited by or strengthened in T samples, indicating that DNA methylation alterations may participate in field cancerization in the urothelium. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the feasibility of cancer risk estimation to identify urothelium at the precancerous stage by DNA methylation quantification. Cancer risk estimation permutation was established using a combination of two marker CpG loci on the HOXC4, TENM3 and TLR1 genes (sensitivity and specificity 96-100%). Among them, the diagnostic impact of 10 patterns of permutation was successfully validated in the validation cohort (sensitivity and specificity 94-98%). These data suggest that cancer risk estimation using procedures such as urine tests during health checkups might become applicable for clinical use.",31241739.txt,1
36921335,Efficacy and Safety of Trastuzumab as a Single Agent in First-Line Treatment of <i>HER2</i>-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer.,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line, single-agent trastuzumab in women with <i>HER2</i>-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.
One hundred fourteen women with <i>HER2</i>-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive first-line treatment with trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg weekly, or a higher 8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 4 mg/kg weekly.
The objective response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.2% to 34.4%), with seven complete and 23 partial responses. Response rates in 111 assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ <i>HER2</i> overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were 35% (95% CI, 24.4% to 44.7%) and none (95% CI, 0% to 15.5%), respectively. The clinical benefit rates in assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ <i>HER2</i> overexpression were 48% and 7%, respectively. The response rates in 108 assessable patients with and without <i>HER2</i> gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were 34% (95% CI, 23.9% to 45.7%) and 7% (95% CI, 0.8% to 22.8%), respectively. Seventeen (57%) of 30 patients with an objective response and 22 (51%) of 43 patients with clinical benefit had not experienced disease progression at follow-up at 12 months or later. The most common treatment-related adverse events were chills (25% of patients), asthenia (23%), fever (22%), pain (18%), and nausea (14%). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in two patients (2%); both had histories of cardiac disease and did not require additional intervention after discontinuation of trastuzumab. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship for response, survival, or adverse events.
Single-agent trastuzumab is active and well tolerated as first-line treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer with <i>HER2</i> 3+ overexpression by IHC or gene amplification by FISH.",36921335.txt,1

31596728,"A molecular sub-cluster of colon cancer cells with low VDR expression is sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors treatment.","Gene expression based consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) sub-clusters are robust colon cancer classification systems. Although, the molecular features are clear, colon cancer subgroups based interventions are limited. To address this problem, we analyze the CMS and NMF subgroup guided drug sensitivity in colon cancer cell lines. CMS3 subtype cells are sensitive to 5-Fluorouracil, while, CMS4 subtype cells are sensitive to cisplatin treatment. In NMF classification, a sub-cluster is specifically sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors, PI3K-mTOR inhibitors and NOTCH inhibitor treatment. This sub-cluster has low frequency of TP53, POLE, PIK3CA and BRAF mutation. Transcriptional analysis demonstrates low NOTCH signaling activity, low CDX2 and VDR expression in this sub-cluster. CDX2 and VDR are significantly associated with the sensitivity of chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors. Moreover, a positive correlation between VDR and CDX2 is identified. VDR and CDX2 mediated regulatory networks are constructed. At last, three or four sub-clusters classification is validated in colon cancer patients. Overall, our results suggest a molecular sub-cluster of colon cancer cells with low CDX2 and VDR expression is sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors treatment and provide an example of translation of cancer classification to subgroup guided therapies.",31596728.txt,1
31103629,HNF1A inhibition induces the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine by targeting ABCB1.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis, and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy remains an effective option for the majority of PDAC patients. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) is a tumor-suppressor in PDAC, but its role in gemcitabine chemoresistance of PDAC has not been clarified. METHODS: The function of HNF1A in gemcitabine was detected by overexpression and knockdown of HNF1A in vitro and in vitro. The regulatory network between HNF1A and ABCB1 was further demonstrated by luciferase assays, deletion/mutation reporter construct assays and CHIP assays. FINDINGS: Here, we found that HNF1A expression is significantly associated with gemcitabine sensitivity in PDAC cell lines. Moreover, we identified that HNF1A overexpression enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity of PDAC both in vitro and in vitro, while inhibition of HNF1A had the opposite effect. Furthermore, by inhibiting and overexpressing HNF1A, we revealed that HNF1A regulates the expression of MDR genes (ABCB1 and ABCC1) in PDAC cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that HNF1A regulates ABCB1 expression through binding to its specific promoter region and suppressing its transcription levels. Finally, the survival analyses revealed the clinical value of HNF1A in stratification of gemcitabine sensitive pancreatic cancer patients. INTERPRETATION: Our study paved the road for finding novel treatment combinations using conventional cytotoxic agents with functional restoration of the HNF1A protein, individualized treatment through HNF1A staining and improvement of the prognosis of PDAC patients.

31100235,Not All Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies Are Equal: The Impact of the Type of Approach and Operator Expertise on the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The extensive use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has led to an even more widespread use of different targeted biopsy techniques and approaches. The best way of performing targeted biopsies and the effect of operator expertise have still to be defined. OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate of detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) of different mpMRI targeted approaches and to assess the role of operator expertise in the detection of csPCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 244 consecutive patients who underwent both 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy and mpMRI targeted biopsy with either a cognitive biopsy (CB) or fusion biopsy (FB) approach during the same session between 2013 and 2016 at a single tertiary referral centre. INTERVENTION: All men underwent 1.5-T mpMRI with an endorectal coil. All biopsies were performed by three operators as their first cases of targeted biopsy. Lesions with a Prostate Imaging Recording and Data System (PI-RADS) v.2 score of >=3 detected at mpMRI were targeted. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: csPCa was defined as disease with a Gleason score at biopsy of >=7. Operator expertise was coded as the progressive number of targeted biopsies performed by each physician. Multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVA) were used to assess the association between the targeted biopsy technique (FB vs CB) and operator expertise for detection of csPCa. Covariates consisted of prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, PI-RADS v.2 (3 vs >3), number of targeted cores per MRI lesion, and digital rectal examination (negative vs positive). The same analyses were performed for patients undergoing FB only after accounting for the FB approach (transrectal vs transperineal). A lowess smoothing weighted function was used to graphically assess the effect of operator expertise on the probability of detecting csPCa, after accounting for all confounders. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 157 patients (64%) underwent FB and 87 (36%) underwent CB. The overall csPCa detection rate was 58% for FB and 45% for CB (p=0.07). A significantly higher rate of csPCa detection in targeted samples was observed for FB compared to CB (57% vs 36%; p=0.002). On MVA, FB and operator expertise were significantly associated with a higher probability of csPCa detection in targeted samples (odds ratio [OR] 2.4 and 1.7, respectively; both p<=0.03). When the same analyses were repeated for patients undergoing FB, operator expertise remained an independent predictor of csPCa detection (OR 1.9; p=0.004). An increase in the probability of detecting csPCa with the number of procedures performed was observed after accounting for all confounders. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that FB had higher detection rate than CB for csPCa. Moreover, operator expertise was significantly associated with higher detection rates for csPCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: When different targeted biopsy techniques were compared, fusion biopsy provided a higher detection rate compared to cognitive biopsy for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Moreover, we found that operator expertise was an important predictor of the detection of csPCa, regardless of the procedure used.",31100235.txt,1
37873196,"Exome copy number variant detection, analysis and classification in a large cohort of families with undiagnosed rare genetic disease.","Copy number variants (CNVs) are significant contributors to the pathogenicity of rare genetic diseases and with new innovative methods can now reliably be identified from exome sequencing. Challenges still remain in accurate classification of CNV pathogenicity. CNV calling using GATK-gCNV was performed on exomes from a cohort of 6,633 families (15,759 individuals) with heterogeneous phenotypes and variable prior genetic testing collected at the Broad Institute Center for Mendelian Genomics of the GREGoR consortium. Each family's CNV data was analyzed using the <i>seqr</i> platform and candidate CNVs classified using the 2020 ACMG/ClinGen CNV interpretation standards. We developed additional evidence criteria to address situations not covered by the current standards. The addition of CNV calling to exome analysis identified causal CNVs for 173 families (2.6%). The estimated sizes of CNVs ranged from 293 bp to 80 Mb with estimates that 44% would not have been detected by standard chromosomal microarrays. The causal CNVs consisted of 141 deletions, 15 duplications, 4 suspected complex structural variants (SVs), 3 insertions and 10 complex SVs, the latter two groups being identified by orthogonal validation methods. We interpreted 153 CNVs as likely pathogenic/pathogenic and 20 CNVs as high interest variants of uncertain significance. Calling CNVs from existing exome data increases the diagnostic yield for individuals undiagnosed after standard testing approaches, providing a higher resolution alternative to arrays at a fraction of the cost of genome sequencing. Our improvements to the classification approach advances the systematic framework to assess the pathogenicity of CNVs.",37873196.txt,0
31492174,The first report of molecular characterized BRD4-NUT carcinoma in Brazil: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: NUT midline carcinoma is a rare and aggressive subset of squamous cell carcinoma, which is characterized by the translocation of nuclear protein in testis gene that is mostly fused with bromodomain and extraterminal family proteins. We describe here the first Brazilian case of NUT midline carcinoma with BRD4-NUT fusion detected in a next-generation sequencing panel and we present the clinical evolution of this patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left maxillary sinus, with negative in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr encoding region and human papillomavirus genotyping. He received induction therapy, chemoradiotherapy with weekly systemic chemotherapy, and, concurrently, weekly intra-arterial chemotherapy. New imaging evaluation, 1 month after the end of the last treatment, revealed a good partial response in the primary lesion. However, positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed multiple suspicious lesions in his bones and lungs, which were histologically confirmed. He died exactly 2 months after metastatic disease was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: NUT midline carcinoma is usually very aggressive. Currently, there is no standard of care for treatment of NUT midline carcinoma. The definitive diagnosis must be by demonstration of NUTM1 rearrangement. Immunohistochemical staining of greater than 50% of tumor nuclei on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the monoclonal rabbit antibody to NUT (clone C52B1), has a specificity of 100%, and sensitivity of 87% for the diagnosis of NUT midline carcinoma. Our case is the first Brazilian case of NUT midline carcinoma with BRD4-NUT fusion.",31492174.txt,1
30897307,Genotype-phenotype correlation in 99 familial adenomatous polyposis patients: A prospective prevention protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a syndrome caused by germline pathogenic variants in the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Identification of APC pathogenic variants sites and the genotype-phenotype correlation are important for characterizing, monitoring, and treating members of affected families. The aim of this study was to correlate genotype-phenotype of Brazilian individuals carrying APC pathogenic germline variants and that have FAP. METHODS: The polyposis phenotype of 99 individuals from 35 families between July 2013 and December 2014 were prospectively evaluated based on the InSIGHT polyposis staging classification. Seven extra-colonic manifestations were assessed and the clinical manifestations correlated with the APC genotype. RESULTS: The age of the study participants ranged from 12 to 67 years (median of 29 years). Twenty-six APC pathogenic variants were identified. Fifty-five cases harbored nonsense pathogenic variants (55.6%). Frameshift alterations were noted in 39 cases (39.4%). Aberrant splicing was noted in 1 case (1%). Rearrangements were observed in 3 cases (3%). An association between nonsense variants and rearrangement was noted in 1 case (1%). The genotype-phenotype correlation analysis led the identification of classic FAP in 94 cases (94.9%). Profuse polyposis was identified in 5 cases (5.1%). Thirty-six cases were diagnosed with cancer of which 29 cases (80.6%) were colorectal cancer, 1 case (2.7%) was brain cancer, 4 cases (11.2%) were papillary thyroid cancer, and 2 cases (5.5%) were stomach cancer. The extra-colonic manifestations included 9 individuals with desmoids tumors, 10 with osteomas, and 9 with congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: The genotype-phenotype correlation in Brazilian individuals with FAP revealed specific findings not previously reported for other cohorts, demonstrating the relevance of knowledge regarding the variable pathogenic variants and clinical presentation in different populations for adequate individual clinical management of patients harboring this medical condition.",30897307.txt,1
31053248,Receptor radionuclide targeting for neuroendocrine tumors (NET) diagnostic and therapy.,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) represent a heterogeneous group of tumors originating from cells of neuroendocrine origin, which express somatostatin receptors (SSTR). This property allowed the successful development of radionuclides for diagnostic and peptide radionuclide radiation therapy (PRRT). This is the paradigm for the theragnostic concept in NET personalized medicine. The only phase III study to date (NETTER-1) clearly demonstrated the ability of 177Lutetium-based PRRT to improve progression-free survival in advanced intestinal NETs. In clinical practice, the indications are limited to G1-G2 well-differentiated NETs with high expression of SSTR. NETs with a low tumor burden and slow progression are probably the optimal indication. This treatment is now available in France. However, its precise position in the treatment algorithm remains to be explored. We provide an overview of receptor radionuclide utilization and mechanism in diagnostic and pretherapeutic imaging and we focus on PRRT for endocrine tumors.",31053248.txt,1

The aim of this study was to analyze the demographic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic variables associated with TDF discontinuation for renal outcomes in stable HIV-positive patients using multivariable analyses. Three hundred and four patients were included (73% male, with median age and eCrCl of 45.3 years and 90.9 mL/min, respectively). After a median follow-up of 28.3 months, 27 patients discontinued TDF for renal adverse events [persistent urinary abnormalities (n = 21) or eCrCl < 60 mL/min (n = 6)] providing an incidence of 3.77 events per 100 patient-year. The probability of TDF discontinuation was higher with several features (male gender, older age, not Caucasians ancestry, absence of intravenous drug abuse, protease inhibitors, previous indinavir, HCV-positivity, lower CD4 cell count, detectable HIV-RNA, lower eCrCl, spot-urine proteinuria) and higher tenofovir concentrations but not genetic variants. Tenofovir plasma concentrations were prognostic of TDF discontinuation for renal adverse events suggesting that dose-adjustment may be warranted for long-term safety.",30405212.txt,0
27698644,Proximal Interphalangeal Joint Fibromatosis After Pyrocarbon Implant Insertion: A Case Report.,"Background: Pyrocarbon implants represent an increasingly popular method to treat proximal interphalangeal joint dysfunction. To this point, no association has been shown between pyrocarbon biomaterials and fibromatosis. We present a potentially serious and destructive complication associated with pyrocarbon arthroplasty. Methods: We demonstrate a clinical case involving pyrocarbon arthroplasty and subsequent fibromatosis development in an otherwise healthy 23-year-old female. To present this association, we illustrate the diagnostic workup involved in a rapidly expanding soft tissue mass of the hand and explain the appropriate treatment. Results: Pyrocarbon arthroplasty was associated with development of locally destructive fibromatosis confirmed by histopathological examination. Treatment involved wide resection with preservation of local structures. Conclusion: We describe the first association between fibromatosis and pyrocarbon biomaterial. Due to fibromatosis destructive effects, clinicians should be aware of potential complications associated with these materials and know how to accurately diagnose and treat these lesions.",27698644.txt,0
36751054,Genomic profiling and prognostic factors of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord diffuse glioma.,"H3 K27-altered diffuse midline glioma is a highly lethal pediatric-type tumor without efficacious treatments. Recent findings have highlighted the heterogeneity among diffuse midline gliomas with different locations and ages. Compared to tumors located in the brain stem and thalamus, the molecular and clinicopathological features of H3 K27-altered spinal cord glioma are still largely elusive, thus hindering the accurate management of patients. Here we aimed to characterize the clinicopathological and molecular features of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord glioma in 77 consecutive cases. We found that the H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord glioma, with a median age of 35 years old, had a significantly better prognosis than H3 K27M-mutant brain tumors. We noticed a molecular heterogeneity of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord astrocytoma via targeted sequencing with 34 cases. TP53 mutation which occurred in 58.8% of cases is mutually exclusive with PPM1D (26%) and NF1 (44%) mutations. The TP53-mutant cases had a significantly higher number of copy number variants (CNV) and a marginally higher proportion of pediatric patients (age at diagnosis <18 years old, p = 0.056). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that the higher number of CNV events (≥3), chromosome (Chr) 9p deletion, Chr 10p deletion, ATRX mutation, CDK6 amplification, and retinoblastoma protein (RB) pathway alteration are associated with worse survival. Cox regression analysis with clinicopathological features showed that glioblastoma histological type and a high Ki-67 index (>10%) are associated with a worse prognosis. Interestingly, the histological type, an independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression, can also stratify molecular features of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord glioma, including the RB pathway, KRAS/PI3K pathway, and chromosome arms CNV. In conclusion, although all H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord diffuse glioma were diagnosed as WHO Grade 4, the histological type, molecular features representing chromatin instability, and molecular alterations associated with accelerated cell proliferative activity should not be ignored in clinical management.",36751054.txt,1
30940785,[A Case of Meningeal Solitary Fibrous Tumour/Haemangiopericytoma WHO Grade III Metastasized to the Spleen Shortly After Tumor Resection].,"Revision of WHO guidelines in 2016 led to the classification of solitary fibrous tumours(SFTs)and haemangiopericytomas(HPCs)as a single tumor entity characterized by NAB2-STAT6 fusion. Standard-of-care treatment involves surgery, but local recurrence and distant metastasis sometimes occur. The average latency to metastasis after surgery is 99 months. A 38-year-old female patient presented with a complaint of headache. An 8x5x2cm lesion showing Gd-T1 enhancement was detected near the superior sagittal sinus. Pathological assessment following resection revealed proliferating, polymorphic, atypical tumor cells with distinct nucleoli in a ""patternless pattern."" Cellularity was moderate to high, and mitotic figures were observed in 15/10 high power fields. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells tested positive for STAT6, and RT-PCR revealed a NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene(exons 6 and 17, respectively), supporting a diagnosis of SFT/HPC WHO grade III. Despite postoperative radiotherapy, multiple metastases to the spleen were detected 8 months after surgery, and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The pathology of the splenic tumor was similar to that of the intracranial tumor. Recurrent disease in a lymph node was detected 1 month later, and local radiation therapy was administered. The patient died of cancerous peritonitis 5 months later. In this case, exceedingly rapid metastasis to the spleen occurred, despite the administration of vigorous treatment. Here, we review SFT/HPC incidence, treatment, and outcomes to better understand this rare malignancy.",30940785.txt,1

36927893,[Orthopaedic Management of Bone Metastasis].,"Thanks to advancement in cancer therapy, an increasing number of cancer patients are expected to live longer with cancer in Japan. Activities of daily living(ADL)and quality of life(QOL)of cancer patients has become much more important than ever. Because a decline in mobility negatively affects ADL and QOL, the management of locomotive organs of cancer patients is crucial. In 2018, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association decided their annual activity theme as""locomotive syndrome in cancer patients"", with the concept of preventing and improving locomotive syndrome for longer and healthier life of cancer patients. Bone metastasis, as a major cause of locomotive syndrome in cancer patients, needs to be evaluated and managed properly for better ADL and QOL of cancer patients. Pathological fractures, spinal instability, and spinal injury cause not only severe pain and massive functional impairment of patients but increased nursing care burden. To resolve these problems, surgery plays a major role. Possible surgical procedures include internal fixation, curettage, cementation, and arthroplasty for the long bones, whereas percutaneous vertebroplasty, decompression, posterior/anterior spinal fusion, and total en bloc spondylectomy for the spine. Less invasive surgical procedure tends to be chosen for a patient with poorer prognosis. The main purpose of bone metastasis surgery is to maintain ADL and QOL of cancer patients hopefully during the remaining survival time; therefore, estimated survival should be considered when determining the surgical strategy. In addition, case-by- case careful peri-operative management is required because cancer therapy can vary widely in patient age, cancer type, and tumor stage. To accommodate the variety of orthopaedic surgeries to the diversity of cancer therapy, the corporation between oncologists and orthopaedic surgeons is indispensable.",36927893.txt,1
38341624,The adaptability of the Pulsta valve to the diverse main pulmonary artery shape of native right ventricular outflow tract disease.,"Pulsta valve is increasingly used for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) in patients with a large native right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). This study aims to elucidate the outcomes of Pulsta valve implantation within the native RVOT and assess its adaptability to various native main pulmonary artery (PA) anatomies.
A multicenter retrospective study included 182 patients with moderate to severe pulmonary regurgitation in the native RVOT who underwent PPVI with Pulsta valves® between February 2016 and August 2023 at five Korean and Taiwanese tertiary referral centers.
Pulsta valve implantation was successful in 179 out of 182 patients (98.4%) with an average age of 26.7 ± 11.0 years. The median follow-up duration was 29 months. Baseline assessments revealed enlarged right ventricle (RV) volume (mean indexed RV end-diastolic volume: 163.1 (interquartile range, IQR: 152.0-180.3 mL/m²), which significantly decreased to 123.6(IQR: 106.6-137.5 mL/m<sup>2</sup>  after 1 year. The main PA types were classified as pyramidal (3.8%), straight (38.5%), reverse pyramidal (13.2%), convex (26.4%), and concave (18.1%) shapes. Pulsta valve placement was adapted, with distal main PA for pyramidal shapes and proximal or mid-PA for reverse pyramidal shapes. Two patients experienced Pulsta valve embolization to RV, requiring surgical removal, and one patient encountered valve migration to the distal main PA, necessitating surgical fixation.
Customized valve insertion sites are pivotal in self-expandable PPVI considering diverse native RVOT shape. The rather soft and compact structure of the Pulsta valve has characteristics to are adaptable to diverse native RVOT geometries.",38341624.txt,0
31119365,[Microsatellite instability : Review of methods and applications].,"After introduction of the Bethesda microsatellite test panel demonstration of microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or loss of mismatch repair proteins (MMRD) was primarily used as a marker for cancer predisposition of Lynch syndrome (LS, previous: HNPCC). Nowadays MSI/MMRD has become an important biomarker to predict therapy response to checkpoint immunotherapies. MSI can be determined either by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technologies with or without specification of fragment sizes or next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. Depending on the individual tumor entities, these test methods are used differently. Currently, MSI/MMRD is a tumor biomarker which covers a broad spectrum of indications in tumor pathology, especially in colorectal, endometrial and gastric cancer. In advanced carcinomas, MSI is an established predictor of therapy response to checkpoint-directed immunotherapies.",31119365.txt,1
30923916,Genetic variants in RPA1 associated with the response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a commonly used first-line chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Genetic variants in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway genes may alter genomic integrity and the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. METHODS: We investigated the association between genetic variants in 19 NER pathway genes and the disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) among 166 colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was performed using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal. Gene harboring significant SNP was overexpressed or knocked down to demonstrate the effect on cell phenotypes with or without oxaliplatin treatment. RESULTS: We found that rs5030740, located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RPA1, was associated with DCR [OR = 2.99 (1.33-5.69), P = 4.00 x 10-3] and PFS [HR = 1.86 (1.30-2.68), P = 7.39 x 10-4]. The C allele was significantly associated with higher RPA1 mRNA expression levels according to eQTL analysis (P = 0.010 for sigmoid colon and P = 0.004 for transverse colon). The C allele of rs5030740 disrupted let-7e-5p binding to enhance RPA1 expression. Functionally, RPA1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis, whereas RPA1 overexpression promoted proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. Furthermore, low RPA1 expression increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells and inhibited proliferation after oxaliplatin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate an association between rs5030740 and the DCR and PFS of colorectal cancer patients. RPA1 functions as a putative oncogene in tumorigenesis by reducing sensitivity to oxaliplatin and could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer.",30923916.txt,1
30955977,"Pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for previously untreated, PD-L1-expressing, locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (KEYNOTE-042): a randomised, open-label, controlled, phase 3 trial.","BACKGROUND: First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy improves overall and progression-free survival in patients with untreated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumour proportion score (TPS) of 50% or greater. We investigated overall survival after treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 213 medical centres in 32 countries. Eligible patients were adults (>=18 years) with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without a sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, life expectancy 3 months or longer, and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. Randomisation was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (>=50% vs 1-49%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0 0122, p=0 0120, and p=0 0124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the previous findings were significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894. FINDINGS: From Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57-69]) with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 patients (64%) had a TPS of 20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12 8 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (>=50% hazard ratio 0 69, 95% CI 0 56-0 85, p=0 0003; >=20% 0 77, 0 64-0 92, p=0 0020, and >=1% 0 81, 0 71-0 93, p=0 0018). The median surival values by TPS population were 20 0 months (95% CI 15 4-24 9) for pembrolizumab versus 12 2 months (10 4-14 2) for chemotherapy, 17 7 months (15 3-22 1) versus 13 0 months (11 6-15 3), and 16 7 months (13 9-19 7) versus 12 1 months (11 3-13 3), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18%) of 636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41%) of 615 in the chemotherapy group and led to death in 13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab monotherapy can be extended as first-line therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or ALK alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS.

37218474,Management of anastomotic leaks after oesophagectomy and gastric pull-up.,"To evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic and surgical intervention in treating anastomotic leaks after oesophagectomy.
Anastomotic leak after oesophagectomy is a severe complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to analyse our experience with the management of anastomotic leak after oesophagectomy.
A retrospective study evaluated the treatment outcome and duration of treatment in patients with anastomotic dehiscence or conduit necrosis after oesophagectomy from November 2008 to November 2021.
The group consists of forty-seven patients. Twenty-one (44.7 %) patients had dehiscence of the neck anastomosis, twenty patients (42.6 %) had dehiscence of the chest anastomosis, and six (12.8 %) patients had conduit necrosis. Nineteen patients with dehiscence were primarily treated by endoscopic insertion of a self-expanding metal stent with perianastomotic drainage; the other patients were primarily treated surgically. Mortality associated with anastomosis dehiscence was 27.7 % (thirteen patients). Stent use in treatment was a statistically significant parameter regarding the length of hospital stay and mortality.
Self-expanding metal stents can reduce leak-related morbidity and mortality after oesophagectomy and may be considered a cost-effective treatment alternative (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 21).",37218474.txt,0
24954252,Accuracy of pedicle screw placement in the thoracic and lumbosacral spine using a conventional intraoperative fluoroscopy-guided technique: a national neurosurgical education and training center analysis of 1236 consecutive screws.,"OBJECTIVE: Pedicle screw placement is a very common procedure used to stabilize all three columns of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of screw misplacement and related complications in patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided transpedicular screw fixation at a neurosurgical teaching institution. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided transpedicular screw fixation from January 2007 to May 2011 in the Department of Neurosurgery, Kantonsspital Aarau, a certified Swiss National Neurosurgical Education and Training Center. The accuracy of the pedicle screw trajectory was assessed using reconstructed postoperative axial, sagittal, and coronal computed tomography images. The displacement was classified as minor (<= 2 mm), moderate (2.1-4 mm), and severe (>4 mm). RESULTS: A total of 1236 pedicle screws were placed in 273 consecutive patients in the thoracic and lumbosacral spine. All surgeries were performed under the supervision of 7 board-certified neurosurgeons and faculty members. A total of 17 surgeons, including trainees, participated in all procedures. A total of 247 (20%) screws breaching the pedicle were identified, with 135 (10.9%) minor violations, 65 (5.3%) moderate violations, and 47 (3.8%) severe violations. Sixteen (5.9%) patients developed postoperative radiculopathy. All of these patients belonged to the subgroup of severe screw displacement. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented confirm that for a training and education center, transpedicular fluoroscopy-guided screw fixation remains a technically demanding procedure. As defined in this study, neurological symptoms are likely associated only with severe screw misplacement.",24954252.txt,0
31623866,The role of exosomes and MYC in therapy resistance of acute myeloid leukemia: Challenges and opportunities.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by abnormal production of white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets. The leukemia cells communicate with their microenvironment through nano-vesicle exosomes that are 30-100 nm in diameter. These nano-vesicles are released from body fluids upon fusion of an endocytic compartment with the cell membrane. Exosomes function as cargo to deliver signaling molecules to distant cells. This allows cross-talk between hematopoietic cells and other distant target cell environments. Exosomes support leukemia growth by acting as messengers between tumor cells and the microenvironment as well as inducing oncogenic factors such as c-Myc. Exosomes have also been used as biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis of leukemia. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are two crucial signaling molecules involved in the AML pathogenesis and MYC stability. GSK-3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that coordinates with over 40 different proteins during physiological/pathological conditions in blood cells. The dysregulation in GSK-3 has been reported during hematological malignancies. GSK-3 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting c-MYC, MCL-1 and beta-catenin. Conversely, GSK-3 can also act as tumor promoter in some instances. The pharmacological modulators of GSK-3 such as ABT-869, 6-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), GS-87 and LY2090314 have shown promise in the treatment of hematological malignancy. PP2A is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of hematological malignancy. PP2A-activating drugs (PADs) can effectively antagonize leukemogenesis. The discovery of exosomes, kinase inhibitors and phosphatase activators have provided new hope to the leukemia patients. This review discusses the role of exosomes, GSK-3 and PP2A in the pathogenesis of leukemia. We provide evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies.",31623866.txt,1
25963654,Spindle Checkpoint Factors Bub1 and Bub2 Promote DNA Double-Strand Break Repair by Nonhomologous End Joining.,"The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is essential for the preservation of genome integrity, as it efficiently repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Previous biochemical and genetic investigations have indicated that, despite the importance of this pathway, the entire complement of genes regulating NHEJ remains unknown. To address this, we employed a plasmid-based NHEJ DNA repair screen in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using 369 putative nonessential DNA repair-related components as queries. Among the newly identified genes associated with NHEJ deficiency upon disruption are two spindle assembly checkpoint kinases, Bub1 and Bub2. Both observation of resulting phenotypes and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Bub1 and -2, either alone or in combination with cell cycle regulators, are recruited near the DSB, where phosphorylated Rad53 or H2A accumulates. Large-scale proteomic analysis of Bub kinases phosphorylated in response to DNA damage identified previously unknown kinase substrates on Tel1 S/T-Q sites. Moreover, Bub1 NHEJ function appears to be conserved in mammalian cells. 53BP1, which influences DSB repair by NHEJ, colocalizes with human BUB1 and is recruited to the break sites. Thus, while Bub is not a core component of NHEJ machinery, our data support its dual role in mitotic exit and promotion of NHEJ repair in yeast and mammals.",25963654.txt,0
25582384,The impact of sensitive KIT D816V detection on recognition of indolent Systemic Mastocytosis.,"Patients with Systemic Mastocytosis (SM) need a highly sensitive diagnostic test for D816V detection of the KIT receptor gene. Along with histology/cytology and flow cytometry evaluation, bone marrow (BM) from 110 consecutive adult patients referred with a suspicion of SM to Multidisciplinary Outpatient Clinic for Mastocytosis in Verona were tested both by Amplification Refractory Mutation System Reverse Transcriptase quantitative real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (ARMS-RT-qPCR) and RT-PCR+Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) followed by Denaturing-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (D-HPLC) and Sanger sequencing. ARMS-RT-qPCR identified D816V mutation in 77 patients, corresponding to 100% of cases showing CD25(+) mast cells (MCs) whereas RT-PCR+RFLP/D-HPLC+sequencing revealed D816V mutations in 47 patients. According to the 2008 WHO criteria 75 SM, 1 Cutaneous Mastocytosis (CM), 1 monoclonal MC activation syndrome (MMAS), and 1 SM Associated with Haematologic Non-Mast Cell Disorder (SM-AHNMD) were diagnosed. Seventeen out 75 SM patients (23%) would have not satisfied sufficient WHO criteria on the basis of the sole RT-PCR+RFLP: these patients had significantly lower serum tryptase levels and amount of CD25(+) MCs. Therefore, ARMS-RT-qPCR might result particularly useful, in patients that do not fulfil major BM histological criterion, for the recognition of indolent SM with a very low MC burden.",25582384.txt,0
24777453,Rare and low-frequency coding variants in CXCR2 and other genes are associated with hematological traits.,"Hematological traits are important clinical parameters. To test the effects of rare and low-frequency coding variants on hematological traits, we analyzed hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit levels, white blood cell (WBC) counts and platelet counts in 31,340 individuals genotyped on an exome array. We identified several missense variants in CXCR2 associated with reduced WBC count (gene-based P = 2.6 x 10(-13)). In a separate family-based resequencing study, we identified a CXCR2 frameshift mutation in a pedigree with congenital neutropenia that abolished ligand-induced CXCR2 signal transduction and chemotaxis. We also identified missense or splice-site variants in key hematopoiesis regulators (EPO, TFR2, HBB, TUBB1 and SH2B3) associated with blood cell traits. Finally, we were able to detect associations between a rare somatic JAK2 mutation (encoding p.Val617Phe) and platelet count (P = 3.9 x 10(-22)) as well as hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.002), hematocrit levels (P = 9.5 x 10(-7)) and WBC count (P = 3.1 x 10(-5)). In conclusion, exome arrays complement genome-wide association studies in identifying new variants that contribute to complex human traits.",24777453.txt,0
31105705,Functional Antibody Responses Following Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for TP53 Mutant pre-B-ALL in a Patient With X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia.,"Patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) have failure of B-cell development with lack of immunoglobulin (Ig) production. While immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) is beneficial, XLA patients remain at risk for infections, structural lung damage, and rarely, neoplasia. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may offer a potential cure, but is associated with significant life-threatening complications. Here, we present a 25-year old XLA patient who developed pre-B acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) with somatic TP53 mutation, and treatment for this high-risk malignancy involved full myeloablative conditioning and a HLA-matched sibling alloSCT. Full donor chimerism was achieved for CD3+ and CD3- cell fractions. The patient remains in morphological and flow cytometric remission 14 months post-transplant, with late-onset oral GvHD requiring low dose prednisolone and cyclosporin. Following IgRT discontinuation at 4 months post-transplantation, humoral immunity was established within 14 months as reflected by normal numbers of total B cells, memory B cells, serum IgG, IgM, and IgA, and production of specific IgG responses to Prevenar-13 vaccination. This is only the second reported case of an XLA patient with pre-B-ALL, and the most detailed report of engraftment following alloSCT in XLA. Together with the two previous XLA cases treated with alloSCT, our report provides evidence for the potential for successful humoral reconstitution with alloSCT in patients with B-cell intrinsic antibody deficiency. These observations may be relevant given IgRT, while beneficial, remains an imperfect solution to long-term infectious complications.",31105705.txt,1
26531733,Neurofibromatosis 1-associated panhypopituitarism presenting as hypoglycaemic seizures and stroke-like symptoms.,"A 37-year-old man with a known history of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) presented within 2 days of diarrhoeal illness followed by encephalopathy, facial twitching, hypoglycaemia, hypotension, tachycardia and low-grade fever. Examination showed multiple cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas over the trunk, arms and legs and receptive aphasia with right homonymous hemianopia, which resolved. Workup for cardiac, inflammatory and infectious aetiologies was unrevealing. A brain MRI showed gyral swelling with increased T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal and diffusion restriction in the left cerebral cortex. Neuroendocrine findings suggested panhypopituitarism with centrally derived adrenal insufficiency. Supportive treatment, hormone supplementation, antibiotics, antivirals and levetiracetam yielded clinical improvement. A follow-up brain MRI showed focal left parieto-occipital atrophy with findings of cortical laminar necrosis. In conclusion, we describe a case of NF1-associated panhypopituitarism presenting as hypoglycaemic seizures and stroke-like findings, hitherto unreported manifestations of NF1. Prompt recognition and treatment of these associated conditions can prevent devastating complications.",26531733.txt,0
25282103,Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height.,"Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified 697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show that the most strongly associated ~2,000, ~3,700 and ~9,500 SNPs explained ~21%, ~24% and ~29% of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/beta-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of causal variants.",25282103.txt,0
31341365,Histologic features and genomic alterations of primary colorectal adenocarcinoma predict growth patterns of liver metastasis.,"BACKGROUND: Different histological growth patterns (HGPs) of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) liver metastasis are associated with patients' prognosis and response to antiangiogenic therapy. However, the relationship between HGPs of liver metastasis and clinicopathological and genomic characteristics of primary cancer has not been well established. AIM: To assess whether certain clinicopathological and genomic features of primary CRC could predict the HGPs of liver metastasis. METHODS: A total of 29 patients with paired resections of both primary CRC and liver metastasis were divided into two groups: A (15 cases with desmoplastic liver metastasis) and B (14 cases with replacement liver metastasis). Clinical information was obtained from patients' charts. Mismatch repair proteins, BRAFV600E, and PD-L1 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Five cases were selected randomly from each group for whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis. RESULTS: In the primary tumor, expanding growth pattern, low tumor budding score (TBS), and Crohn's disease-like response (CDR) were associated with desmoplastic liver metastasis and better overall survival, whereas infiltrating growth pattern alone of primary carcinoma could predict the replacement liver metastasis and worse overall survival (P < 0.05). On WES analysis, primary carcinoma with desmoplastic liver metastasis showed mutations in APC (4/5); TP53 (3/5); KRAS, PIK3CA, and FAT4 (2/5); BRCA-1, BRCA2, BRAF, and DNAH5 (1/5), whereas primary carcinoma with replacement liver metastasis showed mutations in APC and TP53 (3/5); KRAS, FAT4, DNH5, SMAD, ERBB2, ERBB3, LRP1, and SDK1 (1/5). CONCLUSION: The HGPs, TBS, and CDR of primary CRC as well as the presence of specific genetic mutations such as those in PIK3CA could be used to predict the HGPs of liver metastasis, response to therapy, and patients' prognosis.",31341365.txt,1
31043608,Capicua regulates neural stem cell proliferation and lineage specification through control of Ets factors.,"Capicua (Cic) is a transcriptional repressor mutated in the brain cancer oligodendroglioma. Despite its cancer link, little is known of Cic's function in the brain. We show that nuclear Cic expression is strongest in astrocytes and neurons but weaker in stem cells and oligodendroglial lineage cells. Using a new conditional Cic knockout mouse, we demonstrate that forebrain-specific Cic deletion increases proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cells. Furthermore, Cic loss biases neural stem cells toward glial lineage selection, expanding the pool of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). These proliferation and lineage effects are dependent on de-repression of Ets transcription factors. In patient-derived oligodendroglioma cells, CIC re-expression or ETV5 blockade decreases lineage bias, proliferation, self-renewal, and tumorigenicity. Our results identify Cic as an important regulator of cell fate in neurodevelopment and oligodendroglioma, and suggest that its loss contributes to oligodendroglioma by promoting proliferation and an OPC-like identity via Ets overactivity.",31043608.txt,1
24780089,New molecular diagnostic kit to assess Y-chromosome deletions in the Japanese population.,"OBJECTIVES: Deletions in the azoospermia factor regions are the most common known molecular genetic cause of human male infertility involving spermatogenetic failure. Testing for these deletions in Japanese DNA samples using conventional sequence-tagged site probes occasionally lead to considerable non-specific or faint products in the Japanese population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a newly developed kit for the detection of azoospermia factor microdeletions in the Japanese population. METHODS: Sequence-tagged site probes were reselected and the Luminex suspension array assay was carried out. Validation was retrospectively carried out with 2014 DNA sequences with known microdeletions, which were divided into four categories. RESULTS: Category 1 deletions that corresponded to the conventional classification of azoospermia factor deletion were present in 83 men (4.2%), which can result in intrachromosomal homologous recombination. Kit data confirmed the presence of deletions of this type in DNA sequences known to harbor the azoospermia factor deletions. Category 2 deletions involved cytogenetic abnormalities in 28 men (1.4%), whereas category 3 deletions in 759 men (37.7%) were atypical classifications including the gr/gr deletion. As these deletions are thought to be a result of palindromic units and non-homologous recombination, these microdeletions might impact in the interpretation of some clinical findings. The rest of the 1145 cases (56.8%) were assigned to category 4 as normal variants (polymorphism/no deletion). CONCLUSIONS: The present findings show that this new kit offers good sensitivity and specificity with the advantage of saving in terms of cost and time.",24780089.txt,0
30926971,Genomic subtyping and therapeutic targeting of acute erythroleukemia.,"Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) is a high-risk leukemia of poorly understood genetic basis, with controversy regarding diagnosis in the spectrum of myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia. We compared genomic features of 159 childhood and adult AEL cases with non-AEL myeloid disorders and defined five age-related subgroups with distinct transcriptional profiles: adult, TP53 mutated; NPM1 mutated; KMT2A mutated/rearranged; adult, DDX41 mutated; and pediatric, NUP98 rearranged. Genomic features influenced outcome, with NPM1 mutations and HOXB9 overexpression being associated with a favorable prognosis and TP53, FLT3 or RB1 alterations associated with poor survival. Targetable signaling mutations were present in 45% of cases and included recurrent mutations of ALK and NTRK1, the latter of which drives erythroid leukemogenesis sensitive to TRK inhibition. This genomic landscape of AEL provides the framework for accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of this disease, and the rationale for testing targeted therapies in this high-risk leukemia.",30926971.txt,1
31679010,Fine-Needle Aspiration Features of BCOR-CCNB3 Sarcoma.,"OBJECTIVES: BCOR-CCNB3 sarcoma (BCS) is an undifferentiated tumor that has some clinical and morphologic similarity to classic Ewing sarcoma, but it is characterized by a distinct BCOR-CCNB3 gene fusion. There are no reports describing its cytomorphologic findings. METHODS: We describe cytologic findings of five molecularly proven BCS cases (four males and one female, aged 8.5-22 years). RESULTS: Smears showed mainly round cells, but some spindle cells and rhabdoid-like cells were also observed. Dispersed cells dominated in smears, but also distinct pseudopapillary structures with vascular cores were noted in four cases. Scant connective tissue fragments were found in four cases. There was no rosette formation in any case. CONCLUSIONS: BCS should be differentiated from other round cell tumors. Some cytologic features, especially rhabdoid-like cells, connective tissue fragments, and pseudopapillary formations, combined with immunohistochemical and molecular studies, may be helpful in making the appropriate diagnosis.",31679010.txt,1
31481959,A Novel BTK Gene Mutation in a Child With Atypical X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia and Recurrent Hemophagocytosis: A Case Report.,"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), caused by a mutation in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene, is rarely reported in patients with recurrent hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This mutation leads to significantly reduced numbers of circulatory B cells and serum immunoglobulins in patients. Therefore, they exhibit repetitive bacterial infections since infancy, and immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy is the primary treatment. HLH is a life-threatening condition with manifestations of non-remitting fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy, lipid disorder, and multiple organ failure. It is caused by the immune dysregulation between cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and histiocytes. The treatment is based on HLH-2004 protocol including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, supportive therapy, and stem cell transplantation. However, as we know more about the classification and pathophysiology of HLH, the treatment is modified. T-cell-directed immunotherapy is effective in patients with primary HLH, and strong immunosuppression is contraindicated in patients with severe ongoing infections or some primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Here, we report the case of a 7-year-old boy who presented with ecthyma gangrenosum and several episodes of pyogenic infections during childhood. At the age of 5 years, he exhibited cyclic HLH every 2-3 months. The remission of HLH episodes finally achieved after he received monthly Ig replacement therapy (400 mg/kg) at the 4th HLH. However, transient elevation of IgM was incidentally discovered after 6 cycles of monthly Ig replacement therapy. IgM-secreting multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and lymphoma were excluded. The IgM levels then declined and returned to the normal range within a year. The patient and his parents received whole-genome sequencing analysis. It revealed a novel hemizygous c.1632-1G>A mutation in the BTK gene and XLA was diagnosed. XLA exhibits a spectrum of clinical and immunological presentations in patients. The identification of the mutation in the BTK gene contribute to an accurate diagnosis. Ig replacement therapy is the primary treatment for HLH in patients with XLA.",31481959.txt,1

38168382,Unravelling the complexities of DNA-PK activation by structure-based mutagenesis.,"It has been known for decades that the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is only an active serine/threonine protein kinase when it is bound to a DNA double-stranded end; still, the molecular details of how this activation is achieved have remained elusive. The recent surge in structural information for DNA-PK complexes has provided valuable insights into the process of DNA end recognition by DNA-PK. A particularly intriguing feature of this kinase is a region of the protein that can transition from a seemingly structurally disordered state to a single alpha-helix that traverses down the DNA binding cradle. The DNA-PK bound DNA end of the DNA substrate engages with and appears to split around this helix which has been named the <b>D</b>NA <b>E</b>nd <b>B</b>locking helix (DEB). Here a mutational approach is utilized to clarify the role of the DEB, and how DNA ends activate the enzyme. Our data suggest two distinct methods of kinase activation that is dependent on the DNA end chemistry. If the DNA end can split around the helix and stabilize the interaction between the DNA end and the DEB with a recently defined <b>H</b>elix-<b>H</b>airpin-<b>H</b>elix (HHH) motif, the kinase forms an end-protection monomer that is active towards DNA-PK's many substrates. But if the DNA end cannot stably interact with the DEB [because of the DNA end structure, for instance hairpins, or because the DEB has been disrupted by mutation], the kinase is only partially activated, resulting in specific autophosphorylations of the DNA-PK monomer that allows nucleolytic end-processing. We posit that mutants that disrupt the capacity to stably generate the DEB/HHH DNA end-interaction are inefficient in generating the dimer complex that is requisite for NHEJ. In support of this idea, mutations that promote formation of this dimer partially rescue the severe cellular phenotypes associated with mutation of the DEB helix.",38168382.txt,0
37957372,Prediction of mortality and overt hepatic encephalopathy undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: a retrospective cohort study.,"Data on medium- and long-term efficacy and safety of Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) using Viatorr stents in Chinese patients are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the 5-year mortality and the incidence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) after Viatorr stent insertion, and construct a model to predict post-TIPS OHE preoperatively.
One hundred thirty-two patients undergoing Viatorr stent insertion in our institution between August 2016 and December 2019 were included, and randomly divided into training and validation cohort at a 70/30 ratio. Patients were followed up until death or the end date of follow-up (December 31st, 2021). The primary end point was all-cause mortality, and the secondary end points were OHE, variceal rebleeding, recurrent ascites and shunt dysfunction.
The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 92.4%, 87.9%, 85.3%, 80.2% and 80.2%, respectively. Post-TIPS OHE and Child-Pugh grade were independent prognostic factors. The rates of variceal rebleeding, recurrent ascites, shunt dysfunction and post-TIPS OHE were 9.1%, 14.3%, 5.3% and 28.0%, respectively. The variables of nomogram predicting post-TIPS OHE included age, diabetes and ascites grade. The area under time-dependent receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) in training and validation cohort were 0.806 and 0.751, respectively. The decision curve analysis (DCA) showed good net benefit both in training and validation cohort.
Post-TIPS OHE and Child-Pugh grade are independent prognostic factors for early mortality in cirrhosis patients, thus we construct a simple and convenient prediction model for post-TIPS OHE to identify high-risk patients preoperatively.",37957372.txt,0
30896620,Association between KRAS G13D mutations and anastomotic recurrence in colorectal cancer: Two case reports.,"RATIONALE: The prevalence of anastomotic recurrence (AR) in colorectal cancer (CRC) after resection of the primary tumor (PT) is 5% to 14%. However, no association has been observed between specific somatic genetic alterations and AR. Such associations may shed light on the mechanism of AR. PATIENT CONCERNS: We experienced 2 patients with AR of CRC. The first patient was a 42-year-old woman who underwent resection of an AR of rectal cancer 2 times within 19 months after resection of the PT. The second patient was a 77-year-old woman who underwent resection of an AR of ascending colon cancer twice within 38 months after resection of the PT. DIAGNOSIS: Both cases were diagnosed as repetitive AR. INTERVENTIONS: Loss of heterozygosity analysis, microsatellite instability (MSI) study of 9 microsatellite loci, and mutational analysis of KRAS, BRAF, APC, TP53, and SMAD4 were performed. OUTCOMES: All the lesions, except 1, harbored mutations in APC, KRAS, and TP53, without MSI, after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutations were pathogenic or likely pathogenic in the PTs and ARs. Both women harbored the same KRAS G13D mutation, which accounts for 8% of all KRAS mutations in sporadic CRC s. The probability of the incidental occurrence of KRAS G13D mutations in both cases is 0.64%, provided that the mutations were independent of AR. LESSONS: Our findings may shed light on the mechanism of AR in CRC, namely, that the PT harbored the same mutations as the AR and the lesions in both cases harbored the KRAS G13D mutation.",30896620.txt,1
37356622,An Integral Approach to the Molecular Diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: The Role of Mosaicism and Splicing Variants.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the presence of hamartomas in multiple organs. At the molecular level, the disease is caused by pathogenic variants in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, and only 10% to 25% of clinically diagnosed patients remain negative after multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and exon sequencing of both genes. Here, to improve the molecular diagnosis of TSC, we developed an integral approach that includes multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and deep-coverage next-generation sequencing of the entire TSC1 and TSC2 genes, along with an adapted bioinformatic pipeline to detect variants at low allele frequencies (>1%). Using this workflow, the molecular cause was identified in 29 of 42 patients with TSC, describing here, for the first time, 12 novel pathogenic variants in TSC genes. These variants included seven splicing variants, five of which were studied at the cDNA level, determining their effect on splicing. In addition, 8 of the 29 pathogenic variants were detected in mosaicism, including four patients with previous negative study results who presented extremely low mosaic variants (allele frequency, <16%). We demonstrate that this integral approach allows the molecular diagnosis of patients with TSC and improves the conventional one by adapting the technology to the detection of low-frequency mosaics.",37356622.txt,0
36572322,Reconstruction of primary and secondary aortic infections with an antimicrobial graft.,"In situ reconstruction (ISR) with autologous veins is the preferred method in infectious native aortic aneurysms (INAAs) or vascular (endo)graft infection (VGEI). However, access to biological substitutes can prove difficult and lacks versatility. This study evaluates survival and freedom from reinfection after ISR of INAA/VGEI using the antimicrobial Intergard Synergy graft combining silver and triclosan.
From February 2014 to April 2020, 86 antimicrobial grafts were implanted for aortic infection. The diagnosis of INAA/VGEI and reinfection was established based on the Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration criteria. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank P values.
The antimicrobial graft was implanted in 32 cases of INAA, 28 of VGI, and 26 of VEI. The median age was 69.0 (interquartile range: 62.0; 74.0), with a history of coronary artery disease (n = 21; 24.4%), chronic kidney disease (n = 11; 12.8%), cancer (n = 21; 24.4%), and immunosuppression (n = 27; 31.4%). Imaging showed infiltration (n = 14; 16.3%), air (n = 10; 11.6%), and rupture (n = 16; 18.6% including 22 aortoenteric fistulae [AEnF]). Symptoms included fever (n = 37; 43.0%), shock (n = 11; 12.8%), and pain (n = 47; 54.7%). Repair was undertaken through a midline laparotomy in 75 cases (87.2%) and coeliac cross-clamping in 19 (22.1%), suprarenal in 26 (30.2%), plus celiac trunk (n = 3), mesenteric (n = 5), renal (n = 13), or hypogastric (n = 4) artery reconstruction, and omental flap coverage (n = 41; 48.8%). For AEnF, the gastrointestinal tract was repaired using direct suture (n = 14; 16.3%) or resection anastomosis (n = 8; 9.3%). Causative organisms were identified in 74 patients (86.0%), with polymicrobial infection in 32 (37.2%) and fungal coinfection in 7 (8.1%). Thirty-day and in-hospital mortality were 14.0% and 22.1% (n = 12 and 19, respectively, 3 INAA [9.4%], 7 VGI [25.0%], and 9 VEI [34.6%]). Seventy patients (81.4%) had a postoperative complication, 44 (51.2%) of whom returned to the operative room. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 74.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63.3-82.1) and 69.8% (95% CI: 58.5-78.5), respectively. Survival was significantly better for INAA vs VGEI (P = .01) and worse for AEnF (P = .001). Freedom from reinfection was 97.2% (95% CI: 89.2-99.3) and 95.0% (95% CI: 84.8-98.4) with six reinfections (7.0%) requiring two radiological/six surgical drainage and two graft removals. Primary patency was 88.0% (95% CI: 78.1-93.6) and 79.9% (95% CI: 67.3-88.1) with no significant difference between INAA and VGEI (P = .16).
ISR of INAA or VGEI with the antimicrobial graft showed encouraging early mortality, comparable to the rates found in femoral vein (9%-16%) and arterial allograft (8%-28%) studies, as well as mid-term reinfection. The highest in-hospital mortality was noted for VEI including nearly 50% of AEnF.",36572322.txt,1
29856837,Eltrombopag versus romiplostim in treatment of adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia: A systematic review incorporating an indirect-comparison meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: In absence of direct comparison randomized controlled trials (RCTs), indirect comparison was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) in treatment of adult immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database from their earliest records to May 2017. RCTs comparing the TPO-RAs with placebo in adult ITP were included. Primary outcomes were the overall response rate. Secondary outcomes included safety, durable response, overall or clinically significant bleeding, and the proportion of patients receiving rescue medication. RESULTS: Nine randomized placebo-controlled trials (786 participants) were included in this systematic review. Overall response [Risk Ratio(RR) = 0.59, 95%Confidence Interval(CI): 0.24-1.45], the incidence of adverse events (RR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.79-1.21), durable response (RR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.08-2.81), the incidence of overall bleeding (RR = 1.15, 95%CI: 0.52-2.57) and clinically significant bleeding (RR = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.37-3.24), and the proportion of patients receiving rescue treatment (RR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.47-1.90) were similar between eltrombopag and romiplostim. CONCLUSIONS: Eltrombopag and romiplostim might be equivalent in efficacy and safety for adult ITP, however, physicians should still take into account drug cost and comorbidities of the specific patient while making decisions on the treatment of ITP with TPO-RAs.

30963570,Non-V600E BRAF mutations and EGFR signaling pathway in colorectal cancer.,"The Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAFV600E ) mutation (MT) in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is a well-known prognostic indicator and a negative predictive biomarker for antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) treatment. However, the clinical characteristics and significance of BRAFnon-V600E MTs remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the clinical characteristics of BRAFnon-V600E MTs vs. those of other MTs in the EGFR signaling pathway, including BRAFV600E . Consecutive CRC patients in our institute from June 2012 to November 2013 were enrolled in our study. Multiplex genotyping of the EGFR pathway was performed with archival samples using a Luminex Assay for BRAFV600E /BRAFnon-V600E , KRAS/NRAS exons 2-4, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA). We analyzed correlations among the MT profiles, clinical data and primary tumor locations in CRC. All statistical analyses were performed using R software. CRC samples (824) from 374 (45.4%) male and 450 (54.6%) female patients were analyzed, of which 154 (18.7%), 202 (24.5%), 270 (32.8%) or 198 (24.0%) had Stages I, II, III or IV or recurrent CRC, respectively. The frequencies of BRAFV600E /BRAFnon-V600E , KRAS (including exons 2-4), NRAS and PIK3CA MTs were 5.3/1.7, 41.4, 3.3 and 9.6%, respectively. The characteristics of patients with the BRAFV600E MT were an age of >=65 years old, a right-sided primary tumor location, poorly differentiated histology and an advanced disease stage. In contrast, the characteristics of patients with BRAFnon-V600E MTs were a left-sided primary tumor location and well-differentiated histology. BRAFnon-V600E MTs were relatively rare and showed different characteristics compared to the BRAFV600E MT. These results may contribute to future precision medicine.",30963570.txt,1
31191019,NSE from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells regulates macrophage polarization.,"Background/aims: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly common type of malignant and heterogeneous non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Tumor-associated macrophages, specially the M2-type, promote tumor progression and drug resistance. The clinical outcome of patients with high neuron-specific enolase (NSE) expression is worse than that with low NSE expression. The tumor-promoting mechanism of NSE, however, remains unclear. This study explored the role of NSE in macrophage polarization associated with the immune microenvironment of DLBCL. Results: Our results showed that NSE protein expression was higher in lymphoma cell lines than in the B lymphocytes. Functional studies demonstrated that upregulation of NSE in lymphoma cells could promote M2 polarization and migration ability of macrophage, thereby consequently promoting the progression of lymphoma in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanism studies revealed that lymphoma-derived exosomes could mediate NSE into macrophages, NSE enhanced nuclear p50 translocation with subsequent defective classical nuclear factor-kappaB activity in macrophages. Conclusions: These results indicate that NSE may be a potential target for lymphoma therapy and a prognosis marker for lymphoma.",31191019.txt,1
37148359,The power of TOPMed imputation for the discovery of Latino-enriched rare variants associated with type 2 diabetes.,"The Latino population has been systematically underrepresented in large-scale genetic analyses, and previous studies have relied on the imputation of ungenotyped variants based on the 1000 Genomes (1000G) imputation panel, which results in suboptimal capture of low-frequency or Latino-enriched variants. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) released the largest multi-ancestry genotype reference panel representing a unique opportunity to analyse rare genetic variations in the Latino population. We hypothesise that a more comprehensive analysis of low/rare variation using the TOPMed panel would improve our knowledge of the genetics of type 2 diabetes in the Latino population.
We evaluated the TOPMed imputation performance using genotyping array and whole-exome sequence data in six Latino cohorts. To evaluate the ability of TOPMed imputation to increase the number of identified loci, we performed a Latino type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis in 8150 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 10,735 control individuals and replicated the results in six additional cohorts including whole-genome sequence data from the All of Us cohort.
Compared with imputation with 1000G, the TOPMed panel improved the identification of rare and low-frequency variants. We identified 26 genome-wide significant signals including a novel variant (minor allele frequency 1.7%; OR 1.37, p=3.4 × 10<sup>-9</sup>). A Latino-tailored polygenic score constructed from our data and GWAS data from East Asian and European populations improved the prediction accuracy in a Latino target dataset, explaining up to 7.6% of the type 2 diabetes risk variance.
Our results demonstrate the utility of TOPMed imputation for identifying low-frequency variants in understudied populations, leading to the discovery of novel disease associations and the improvement of polygenic scores.

29984440,Type-3 von Willebrand disease in India-Clinical spectrum and molecular profile.,"INTRODUCTION: Type 3 von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the rare and most severe form of VWD which results from a near-complete deficiency of the von Willebrand factor (VWF). This study evaluates in detail the molecular pathology of type-3 VWD in India. One hundred and two patients from 90 families were evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Phenotypic data, including bleeding scores (BS), were documented using structured questionnaires. Diagnosis of type 3 VWD was based on undetectable VWF antigen levels in the plasma. Genomic DNA from these patients was screened for mutations in VWF gene. Structural modeling and expression studies were carried out for missense mutations. RESULTS: Out of 102 patients, mutations could be identified in 91% (n = 93). Fifty-five different gene variants were identified. Thirty-four (61.8%) were novel. Mutations could be identified in both the alleles in 90 patients, while no causative mutation could be identified in 9 patients; twenty-four (23.5%) patients had mutations clustered in the propeptide region of VWF. Interestingly, five mutations accounted for the defects in 37/93 (39.8%) patients.

31371806,Myeloid neoplasms in the setting of sickle cell disease: an intrinsic association with the underlying condition rather than a coincidence; report of 4 cases and review of the literature.,"Myeloid neoplasms occasionally occur in patients with sickle cell disease, and the underlying connection between the two diseases is unclear. Herein, we retrospectively analyzed four cases of sickle cell disease patients who developed myeloid neoplasm. Age at time of diagnosis ranged from 27 to 59 years with a median of 35.5 years. Two patients were treated with hydroxyurea and the other two with supportive care alone, with one out of the four patients receiving additional treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Three patients presented with leukocytosis, and the remaining patient presented with pancytopenia. Two patients were diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm, one with myelodysplastic syndrome, and the other with acute myeloid leukemia. All four cases demonstrated certain degrees of myelodysplasia and complex cytogenetic abnormalities with - 7/7q- and/or - 5/5q- or with 11q23 (KMT2A) rearrangement. This cytogenetic profile resembles that seen in therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, suggesting that myeloid neoplasm in the setting of sickle cell disease may represent a subcategory of the disease distinct from de novo myeloid neoplasm in general. Extensive literature review further demonstrates this similarity in cytogenetic profile, as well as in other associated pathologic features. Potential etiology includes therapy for sickle cell disease, disease-related immunomodulation, or disease-related chronic inflammation. We hypothesize that constant hematopoietic hyperplasia, stimulated by a hemolysis-induced cytokine storm, may increase the chance of somatic mutations/cytogenetic aberrations, resulting in transformation of myeloid precursors. This group of myeloid neoplasms seems to herald a dismal clinical outcome, with median survival <1 year, although the exact pathogenesis and biology of the disease remain to be investigated by large cohorts in future studies.",31371806.txt,1
29339522,Effect of beta-agonists on LAM progression and treatment.,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare disease of women, is associated with cystic lung destruction resulting from the proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle-like LAM cells with mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes TSC1 and/or TSC2 The mutant genes and encoded proteins are responsible for activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is inhibited by sirolimus (rapamycin), a drug used to treat LAM. Patients who have LAM may also be treated with bronchodilators for asthma-like symptoms due to LAM. We observed stabilization of forced expiratory volume in 1 s over time in patients receiving sirolimus and long-acting beta-agonists with short-acting rescue inhalers compared with patients receiving only sirolimus. Because beta-agonists increase cAMP and PKA activity, we investigated effects of PKA activation on the mTOR pathway. Human skin TSC2+/- fibroblasts or LAM lung cells incubated short-term with isoproterenol (beta-agonist) showed a sirolimus-independent increase in phosphorylation of S6, a downstream effector of the mTOR pathway, and increased cell growth. Cells incubated long-term with isoproterenol, which may lead to beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization, did not show increased S6 phosphorylation. Inhibition of PKA blocked the isoproterenol effect on S6 phosphorylation. Thus, activation of PKA by beta-agonists increased phospho-S6 independent of mTOR, an effect abrogated by beta-agonist-driven receptor desensitization. In agreement, retrospective clinical data from patients with LAM suggested that a combination of bronchodilators in conjunction with sirolimus may be preferable to sirolimus alone for stabilization of pulmonary function.",29339522.txt,0
36931075,Adjuvant durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC harbouring uncommon genomic alterations.,"Adjuvant durvalumab is the standard of care for patients with stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), without progression after concurrent chemo-radiation (CCRT). Patients with stage III NSCLC harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements do not seem to benefit from durvalumab. Data are lacking about patients harbouring other driver genomic alterations (dGA). We performed a multicentre (N = 4, Netherlands and Italy) retrospective study including consecutive patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC and treated with CCRT-with or without adjuvant durvalumab-between 2016 and 2022. We enrolled 271 patients; 130 of which received adjuvant durvalumab. Sixty-six patients had dGA (41 KRAS mutations, 4 EGFR common mutations and 21 uncommon dGA). In the entire population, the median PFS was 24.9 months (95% CI 17.5-32.4) and 12.6 months (95% CI 9.0-16.1) with and without durvalumab (p = 0.001). In the dGA group (excluding common EGFR), mPFS was 12.3 months (95% CI 7.8-16.8) with and 7.6 (95% CI 3.4-11.9) without durvalumab (p = 0.038). For patients with KRAS mutations, mPFS was 12.3 months (95% CI 3.6-20.9) with and 7.2 months (95% CI 1.8-12.6) without durvalumab (p = 0.12). Among patients with uncommon dGA, mPFS was 12.9 months (95% CI 8.4-17.4) with and 7.6 months (95% CI 1.4-14) without durvalumab (p = 0.23). We have shown a meaningful survival benefit of adjuvant durvalumab in patients harbouring KRAS mutations and uncommon dGA. This is the largest stage III NSCLC cohort showing the efficacy of durvalumab in patients with uncommon dGA. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our results.",36931075.txt,1
26022167,Tuberous sclerosis complex.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal-dominant, neurocutaneous, multisystem disorder characterized by cellular hyperplasia and tissue dysplasia. The genetic cause is mutations in the TSC1 gene, found on chromosome 9q34, and TSC2 gene, found on chromosome 16p13. The clinical phenotypes resulting from mutations in either of the 2 genes are variable in each individual. Herein, advances in the understanding of molecular mechanisms in tuberous sclerosis complex are reviewed, and current guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and management are summarized.",26022167.txt,0
36210487,Black Patients with Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Have a Shorter Time Interval Between PSA and Clinical Progression on Novel Hormonal Therapies plus Avelumab.,"Black men are at higher risk for prostate cancer death. Previous studies showed a benefit of different therapies, including immune-based therapy, for Black men with metastatic prostate cancer. We sought to explore the efficacy of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab in Black men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing after abiraterone or enzalutamide.
This pilot phase II study enrolled self-identified Black patients who developed mCRPC on next-generation hormonal therapies (NHTs) abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (NCT03770455). Enrolled patients received avelumab 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks while remaining on the same NHTs. The primary endpoint of our study was ≥ 50% reduction in prostate specific antigen (PSA) at ≥8 weeks.
A total of eight patients were enrolled. The median duration on NHTs prior to enrollment was 364 days (95% CI, 260.9-467.1). The median time to initiate avelumab was 8 days (3-14). With a median follow-up of 196 days, no patients achieved the primary endpoint. The median time to PSA progression was 35 days (95 CI%, 0-94.8) and the median time to radiographic and/or clinical progression was 44 days (95 CI%, 0-118.5). The study was closed prematurely due to safety concerns related to the rapid clinical progression observed in the patients enrolled on study.
In conclusion, the addition of avelumab to NHT did not demonstrate clinical activity in Black men with new mCRPC. The unexpected short interval between PSA and radiographic and/or clinical progression observed in this study has potential clinical implications.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03770455 (IND number 139559).",36210487.txt,1
29370381,Ablation of Grb10 Specifically in Muscle Impacts Muscle Size and Glucose Metabolism in Mice.,"Grb10 is an adaptor-type signaling protein most highly expressed in tissues involved in insulin action and glucose metabolism, such as muscle, pancreas, and adipose. Germline deletion of Grb10 in mice creates a phenotype with larger muscles and improved glucose homeostasis. However, it has not been determined whether Grb10 ablation specifically in muscle is sufficient to induce hypermuscularity or affect whole body glucose metabolism. In this study we generated muscle-specific Grb10-deficient mice (Grb10-mKO) by crossing Grb10flox/flox mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the human alpha-skeletal actin promoter. One-year-old Grb10-mKO mice had enlarged muscles, with greater cross-sectional area of fibers compared with wild-type (WT) mice. This degree of hypermuscularity did not affect whole body glucose homeostasis under basal conditions. However, hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp studies revealed that Grb10-mKO mice had greater glucose uptake into muscles compared with WT mice. Insulin signaling was increased at the level of phospho-Akt in muscle of Grb10-mKO mice compared with WT mice, consistent with a role of Grb10 as a modulator of proximal insulin receptor signaling. We conclude that ablation of Grb10 in muscle is sufficient to affect muscle size and metabolism, supporting an important role for this protein in growth and metabolic pathways.",29370381.txt,0
31366136,Early Colorectal Cancers Provide New Evidence for a Lynch Syndrome-to-CMMRD Phenotypic Continuum.,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome, caused by heterozygous mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Biallelic mutations in these genes lead however, to constitutive mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD). In this study, we follow the diagnostic journey of a 12-year old patient with CRC, with a clinical phenotype overlapping CMMRD. We perform molecular and functional assays to discard a CMMRD diagnosis then identify by exome sequencing and validation in a cohort of 134 LS patients, a candidate variant in the MLH1 UTR region in homozygosis. We propose that this variant, together with other candidates, could be responsible for age-of-onset modulation. Our data support the idea that low-risk modifier alleles may influence early development of cancer in LS leading to a LS-to-CMMRD phenotypic continuum. Therefore, it is essential that larger efforts are directed to the identification and study of these genetic modifiers, in order to provide optimal cancer prevention strategies to these patients.",31366136.txt,1
30513309,Circular RNA involvement in aging: An emerging player with great potential.,"Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of newly discovered noncoding RNA (ncRNA), presenting as a special covalent loop without a 5' cap or 3' tail. Multiple biological properties of circRNA have been revealed during the past decades, such as widespread expression, high conservation, cell-specificity, tissue-specificity and developmental stage-specific expression patterns, as well as resistance to RNase R digestion. CircRNA also exhibits diverse biological functions, including regulation of host genes, alternative splicing, miRNA sponges, protein traps and even protein synthesis. Recently, a global accumulation of circRNAs during aging has been identified across different species, indicating a potential role as a causal factor in aging and age-related disease. The high stability could be one of the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon. CircRNA could play a role in aging, such as neural aging, muscle aging, reproductive aging, skin aging, immunosenescence, visual aging and age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, via interaction with miRNAs, RNA binding proteins, modulation of parental gene transcription, mainly at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The present study will focus on the advancement of circRNA regarding aging and age-related diseases. We will also discuss the biogenesis, properties, biological functions, and the perspectives of circRNA.",30513309.txt,0
31292797,Lynch syndrome with exclusive skin involvement: time to consider a molecular definition?,"Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is clinically characterized by the occurrence of skin, usually sebaceous, and visceral tumors in the same individual. The most common underlying mechanism is a constitutional defect of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes that cause Lynch syndrome (LS). Herewithin we report on a 76 years-old male patient heterozygous for a pathogenic MSH2 missense substitution who presented with a striking cutaneous phenotype in the absence of typical LS visceral tumors. The patient developed 20 skin tumors, including sebaceous adenomas/carcinomas and keratoacanthomas. Two skin tumors showed immunohistochemical loss of MSH2 and MSH6 expression. There was no apparent family history of neoplasia. Based on the variable involvement of the skin and internal organs, we suggest that the definition of tumor associations that are often observed as variants of inherited tumor syndromes, such as MTS, should be guided by the underlying molecular bases. In addition, the presence of multiple sebaceous tumors, especially if showing MMR deficiency, appears to be a very strong indicator of a constitutional MMR gene defect. The reasons underlying the high phenotypic variability of cutaneous phenotypes associated with constitutional MMR defects are yet to be determined.",31292797.txt,1
24807696,Novel mechanism of transcriptional repression of the human ATP binding cassette transporter A1 gene in hepatic cells by the winged helix/forkhead box transcription factor A2.,"ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in the biogenesis of HDL by promoting the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid free apoA-I. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene cause Tangier disease which is characterized by near or complete absence of circulating plasma HDL. In the present study we show that the winged helix/forkhead box containing transcription factor A2 (FOXA2) shown previously to play a role in glucose and bile acid homeostasis in the liver and in energy utilization in adipose tissue is a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells. We show that the ABCA1 promoter contains three FOXA2 binding elements in the proximal region. Two of the sites are localized in a region of the ABCA1 promoter enriched in binding elements for transcriptional repressor proteins whereas the third site is the core of the TATA element of the ABCA1 promoter. Inhibition of FOXA2 binding to the ABCA1 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis or FOXA2 gene expression by siRNA was associated with increased ABCA1 promoter activity and protein levels. Overexpression of FOXA2 inhibited both the constitutive ABCA1 gene expression as well as ABCA1 gene induction by oxysterols and retinoids via nuclear receptors LXRalpha/RXRalpha. In summary, the present study identifies transcription factor FOXA2 as a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells and reveals a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by FOXA2 which involves the TATA element of the ABCA1 gene.",24807696.txt,0
38243854,Prior male sling does not affect outcomes of artificial urinary sphincter.,"To investigate the outcomes of artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) placement in patients with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPUI) with or without a prior male sling.
We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent AUS for PPUI from 2007 to 2022. The primary endpoint was to determine the proportion of patients who achieved social continence, defined as self-reported use of 0-1 pad/day. The secondary endpoints were device failure rates and device failure-free survival.
The analysis included 210 patients, with 30 (14.3%) having had prior slings and 180 (85.7%) without prior slings. After AUS insertion, 80.0% of patients with prior slings and 76.7% of those without prior slings achieved continence (0-1 pad/day). There were six (20.0%) and 53 (29.4%) device failures in patients with and without prior slings, respectively. The median device failure-free survival was not reached in patients with prior slings and was 8.9 years in patients without prior slings (P = 0.048). Limitations include retrospective nature and small sample size.
The efficacy and safety of AUS in patients with prior slings are similar to those without. Prior sling is associated with a longer device failure-free survival. AUS remains a viable option in patients who have persistent PPI after prior slings.",38243854.txt,0
30895378,DNA methylation profiling distinguishes Ewing-like sarcoma with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion from Ewing sarcoma.,"PURPOSE: Recent studies revealed divergent gene expression patterns in Ewing sarcoma (EwS) with canonical EWSR1-ETS gene fusions and undifferentiated round cell sarcomas (URCS) with EWSR1 rearrangements fused to the non-ETS gene NFATc2. Thus, the question arises whether the latter tumors really belong to EwS. METHODS: We collected five cases matching the group of URCS with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion and performed DNA methylation and copy number profiling. Results were compared to methylation data of 30 EwS with various EWSR1-ETS fusions and one EwS with FUS-ERG fusion, 16 URCS with CIC rearrangement and 10 URCS with BCOR alteration and a total of 81 EWSR1-associated soft tissue sarcomas including 7 angiomatoid fibrous histiocytomas, 7 clear cell sarcomas of the soft tissue, 28 desmoplastic small round cell tumors, 10 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas and 29 myxoid liposarcomas. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis of DNA methylation data revealed a homogeneous methylation cluster for URCS with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion, which clearly segregated from EwS and the other subtypes. Copy number profiles of EWSR1-NFATc2 cases showed recurrent losses on chromosome 9q and segmental gains on 20q13 and 22q12 involving the EWSR1 and NFATc2 loci, respectively. CONCLUSION: In summary, URCS with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion share a distinct DNA methylation signature and carry characteristic copy number alterations, which emphasizes that these sarcomas should be considered separately from EwS.",30895378.txt,1
37907381,Variant Classification for Pompe disease; ACMG/AMP specifications from the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases Variant Curation Expert Panel.,"Accurate determination of the clinical significance of genetic variants is critical to the integration of genomics in medicine. To facilitate this process, the NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has assembled Variant Curation Expert Panels (VCEPs), groups of experts and biocurators which provide gene- and disease- specifications to the American College of Medical Genetics & Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology's (ACMG/AMP) variation classification guidelines. With the goal of classifying the clinical significance of GAA variants in Pompe disease (Glycogen storage disease, type II), the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases (LD) VCEP has specified the ACMG/AMP criteria for GAA. Variant classification can play an important role in confirming the diagnosis of Pompe disease as well as in the identification of carriers. Furthermore, since the inclusion of Pompe disease on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) for newborns in the USA in 2015, the addition of molecular genetic testing has become an important component in the interpretation of newborn screening results, particularly for asymptomatic individuals. To date, the LD VCEP has submitted classifications and supporting data on 243 GAA variants to public databases, specifically ClinVar and the ClinGen Evidence Repository. Here, we describe the ACMG/AMP criteria specification process for GAA, an update of the GAA-specific variant classification guidelines, and comparison of the ClinGen LD VCEP's GAA variant classifications with variant classifications submitted to ClinVar. The LD VCEP has added to the publicly available knowledge on the pathogenicity of variants in GAA by increasing the number of expert-curated GAA variants present in ClinVar, and aids in resolving conflicting classifications and variants of uncertain clinical significance.",37907381.txt,0
31647020,A rare simultaneous coexistence of epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumors and schwannoma in the stomach: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), a type of mesenchymal tumor in the gastrointestinal tract, are believed to be closely associated with PDGFRA and C-KIT mutations. Schwannoma in the stomach, which is an unusual location, is a rare disorder. The simultaneous occurrence of the two diseases is rarer than metachronous occurrences, and its pathological characteristics have not been reported to date. We present a case report on a patient with simultaneous coexistence of gastric schwannoma and GISTs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old female visited our hospital complaining of intermittent abdominal pain for the previous 3 months. CT revealed a 3.4 cm slight homogeneous enhancement in the lesser curvature of the stomach; the mass was nodular soft tissue, which was removed by radical surgery. Two solid tumors with different volumes were located in the stomach. Histologically and immunohistochemically different, the larger tumor consisted of spindle cells surrounded by a peripheral lymphoid cuff, and was positive for S-100. The larger tumor was therefore classified as a gastric schwannoma. The smaller tumor was composed of medium-sized round, oval cells with amphiphilic granular cytoplasm; vacuolization was also observed. The tumor cells were positive for DOG1 and sporadically positive for CD34 and CD117. Hence, the smaller tumor was diagnosed as epithelioid GISTs. Sanger sequencing revealed that the GIST tumor cells contained a deletion mutation (c.2527_2538 del12,843-846del4), which was located in exon 18 of PDGFRA. CONCLUSION: GISTs combined with gastric schwannoma are a considerably rare subgroup of gastric tumors. Related clinical research is comparatively weak, and the mechanism remains unknown. We reviewed related articles to provide knowledge to improve the correct identification, diagnosis and management of patients with gastric cancer. All pathologists involved in the diagnosis and clinicians involved in the treatment should be aware of this new kind of disease pattern to improve their understanding of the disease.",31647020.txt,1
25623620,Hypogammaglobulinemia in children after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a cytokine mediated immunoglobulin isotype class switch arrest?,"BACKGROUND: Hypogammaglobulinemia (hypo-IgG) is common early post-HSCT in children, occasionally necessitating long-term immunoglobulin (Ig) G replacement therapy. IgG replacement may not reduce mortality, although infectious complications are decreased PROCEDURE: Clinical data and samples from 86 children were analyzed retrospectively with the aim to identify risk factors for developing long-term hypo-IgG (i.e., requiring >= 3 months IgG replacement) post-HSCT and studying the underlying biology. Laboratory studies covered serum cytokines, IGHG2 genotyping and routine laboratory investigations. Results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of the children developed long-term hypo-IgG. These children were younger (<5 years) and had higher acute GvHD incidence, but had better overall survival (88% vs. 69%, P = 0.036). Significantly lower Ig levels post-HSCT but equal immune cell recovery were seen in patients with long-term hypo-IgG compared with those of transient or no hypo-IgG. Pre-HSCT IL-6 and -7 and post-HSCT BAFF and APRIL levels were significantly higher in the long-term hypo-IgG group. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggests an unfavorable cytokine milieu for graft-derived immune recovery, possibly inducing Ig isotype class switch arrest. Younger age, acute GvHD, and higher pre-HSCT IL-6 levels were identified as significant risk factors for long-term hypo-IgG. Long-term hypo-IgG post-HSCT does not need to be unfavorable and could be an effect of deteriorated cytokine signaling.",25623620.txt,0
26485416,Cerebellar Enterogenous Cyst with Atypical Appearance and Pathological Findings.,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial enterogenous cysts are rare and occur mainly in the posterior fossa. These cysts are usually extra-axial, midline, anterior to the brainstem, or at the cerebellopontine angle. Intracranial intra-axial enterogenous cysts are extremely rare. We report a case of an intra-axial cerebellar enterogenous cyst in which diagnosis was difficult because the lesion resembled an arachnoid cyst in appearance and showed atypical pathologic findings. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman had a 2-year history of progressive headache, giddiness, and unsteadiness of gait. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion with isointensity to cerebrospinal fluid in the left cerebellar hemisphere, reaching into the fourth ventricle. The patient underwent fenestration of the cyst and creation of a communication between the fourth ventricle and cyst because the tight attachment of the cyst wall to the cerebellum prevented total removal of the cyst. Although pathologic examinations did not show findings typical of enterogenous cyst, the diagnosis was finally made based on the presence of basement membrane and immunohistochemical results. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of enterogenous cyst is based mainly on histologic findings, because characteristic findings on neuroimaging have not been defined. Although total resection of enterogenous cysts is recommended in general, partial resection while ensuring the cyst communicates adequately with the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid space with or without a shunt procedure may be useful if the cyst is adherent to surrounding neurovascular structures.",26485416.txt,0
31095042,"The programmed cell death protein-1/programmed cell death ligand 1 expression, CD3+ T cell infiltration, NY-ESO-1 expression, and microsatellite instability phenotype in primary cutaneous melanoma and mucosal melanoma and their clinical significance and prognostic value: a study of 89 consecutive cases.","We evaluated the expression of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and NY-ESO-1 antigen; the infiltration of CD3+ T cells; and the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype, as well as the relationship of each factor to survival in malignant melanoma patients. Malignant melanoma samples from 89 patients were stained by immunohistochemistry to evaluate PD-1, PD-L1, CD3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), NY-ESO-1, and MSI. PD-1 and PD-L1 were expressed in 19.1 and 32.6% of the 89 samples, respectively. There was a significant correlation between PD-1 and PD-L1 expression (r = 0.207, P = 0.046). High infiltration of CD3+ T cells was observed in 41.6% of the samples, and increased cell infiltration was associated with increased PD-1 expression (P = 0.001). NY-ESO-1 antigen was detected in 13.5% of all samples, and the expression of NY-ESO-1 was positively correlated with the expression of PD-1 (P < 0.001). In our research, MSI was detected in 18 samples (20.2%). Survival analysis showed that a high infiltration of CD3+ T cells was related to longer progression-free survival (PFS) [24.0 months, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.4-40.6 vs. 11.0 months, 95% CI: 7.1-12.9, P = 0.031], similarly, the median overall survival (OS) of the CD3+ T cell high-infiltration patients was also longer (53.0 vs. 38.0 months), but with no statistical significance (P = 0.200). The results for the immune markers mentioned above provide a theoretical basis for the prognosis and immunotherapy selection of malignant melanoma patients.",31095042.txt,1
29945600,Membrane-bound and soluble forms of an NMDA receptor extracellular domain retain epitopes targeted in auto-immune encephalitis.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (ANRE) is a potentially lethal disease attributed to auto-antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Full recovery is possible if therapy is initiated early in the disease course. Detection of ANRE antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential for diagnosis. The assays for ANRE-associated IgGs often rely on cells transiently transfected with NMDAR genes. A cell line that stably expresses pathogenic NMDAR epitopes could improve standardization of the assays and provide antigen that could be used in commercial solid state assay systems. RESULTS: We expressed the amino terminal domain (ATD) of the GluN1 NMDAR subunit (NR1) as a fusion protein on the outer plasma membrane of 293T cells, creating a stable cell population (293T-ATD) that is recognized by ANRE patient monoclonal antibodies in flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays. The ATD fusion protein also contains a Myc tag and a 6XHIS tag, which provide functionality for immunoassays and antigen purification, and a TEV protease site, which allows the ATD domain to be specifically released from the cells in essentially pure form. ATD mobilized from the 293T ATD cell line maintained the pathogenic ANRE epitopes in ELISA binding assays. CSF (3/4) and sera (4/4) from ANRE patients also bound the 293T-ATD cell line, whereas normal CSF and sera did not. CONCLUSIONS: The 293T-ATD cell line is potentially adaptable to a variety of formats to identify antibodies associated with ANRE, including cell-based and soluble antigen formats, and demonstrates a useful method to produce complex proteins for research, drug discovery, and clinical diagnosis.",29945600.txt,0
31240453,[Round-cell sarcomas].,"Round-cell sarcomas represent highly malignant tumors that occur predominantly in children, adolescents, and young adults. Round-cell sarcomas are caused by recurrent translocations that involve certain transcription factors. Ewing's sarcoma, Ewing-like sarcomas (e.g. CIC-DUX positive or BCOR positive sarcomas), desmoplastic small round-cell tumors (DSRCTs), and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMs) are typical examples of this particular group of sarcomas. These entities differ in their tumor genetics, which is correlated with immunohistochemical expression profiles and with clinical phenotypes. Classification should be based on molecular findings. Immunohistochemistry may serve as a surrogate marker.",31240453.txt,1
30884810,PFKFB2 Promoter Hypomethylation as Recurrence Predictive Marker in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Carcinomas.,"Despite the low mortality rates, well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTC) frequently relapse. BRAF and TERT mutations have been extensively related to prognosis in thyroid cancer. In this study, the methylation levels of selected CpGs (5-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3) comprising a classifier, previously reported by our group, were assessed in combination with BRAF and TERT mutations. We evaluated 121 WDTC, three poorly-differentiated/anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (PDTC/ATC), 22 benign thyroid lesions (BTL), and 13 non-neoplastic thyroid (NT) tissues. BRAF (V600E) and TERT promoter (C228T and C250T) mutations were tested by pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing, respectively. Three CpGs mapped in PFKFB2, ATP6V0C, and CXXC5 were evaluated by bisulfite pyrosequencing. ATP6V0C hypermethylation and PFKFB2 hypomethylation were detected in poor-prognosis (PDTC/ATC and relapsed WDTC) compared with good-prognosis (no relapsed WDTC) and non-malignant cases (NT/BTL). CXXC5 was hypomethylated in both poor and good-prognosis cases. Shorter disease-free survival was observed in WDTC patients presenting lower PFKFB2 methylation levels (p = 0.004). No association was observed on comparing BRAF (60.7%) and TERT (3.4%) mutations and prognosis. Lower PFKFB2 methylation levels was an independent factor of high relapse risk (Hazard Ratio = 3.2; CI95% = 1.1-9.5). PFKFB2 promoter methylation analysis has potential applicability to better stratify WDTC patients according to the recurrence risk, independently of BRAF and TERT mutations.",30884810.txt,1
31163629,Prostaglandin E-Major Urinary Metabolite (PGE-MUM) as a Tumor Marker for Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"Background: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is metabolized to prostaglandin E-major urinary metabolite (PGE-MUM). Enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression demonstrated in lung adenocarcinoma indicates increased PGE-MUM levels in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Objectives: We aimed to elucidate the clinical usefulness of measuring PGE-MUM as an indicator of tumor burden in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: PGE-MUM was measured by a radioimmunoassay in control healthy volunteers (n = 124) and patients with lung adenocarcinoma (n = 54). Associations between PGE-MUM levels and clinical characteristics of the patients (including lung cancer stage and TNM factors (T: Tumor, N: Node, M: Metastasis) were examined. Results: PGE-MUM levels were significantly elevated in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. A PGE-MUM level of 14.9 mug/g Cr showed 70.4% sensitivity and 67.7% specificity for the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. PGE-MUM levels tended to be positively correlated with cancer progression as determined by the TNM staging system. Advanced stage (stage III, stage IV, and recurrence) was significantly associated with high PGE-MUM levels by logistic regression analysis. No apparent correlation was demonstrated between PGE-MUM and carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Conclusions: PGE-MUM can be a promising biomarker reflecting the systemic tumor burden of lung adenocarcinoma.",31163629.txt,1
36586323,Is there a role for tumor volume in prediction of prognosis for oral cancer?,"New prognostic factors in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (tumor-, host-, and environment-related) have been introduced recently to complete those traditionally considered. Among them, tumor volume (TV) could be the most interesting and applicable in clinical practice, considering the routine use of computed tomography in tumor staging. In this retrospective study we aimed to investigate whether a correlation exists among these new prognostic factors and survival outcomes.
We collected data about 140 patients affected by OSCC who underwent primary surgery. Prognostic factors were collected and Overall Survival (OS), Disease Specific Survival (DSS) and Disease Free Survival (DFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method; the Log-Rank test (Mantel-Cox) and Cox regression models were applied to investigate predictors of survival.
The 5-year OS, DSS and DFS were 73.6 %, 89.2 % and 75.2 % respectively. Nodal metastasis (pN+), relapse and American Society of Anesthesiologists ASA-II were found independent prognostic factors for OS, and significantly associated to worst DSS (p < 0.001). TV significantly correlated with higher relapse occurrence (p = 0.03).
In our experience, lymph-node status, ASA classification and relapse significantly influenced DSS on univariate analysis. TV could represent an interesting additional parameter, since it significantly influenced DFS. However, prospective studies with standardized TV measurements and a greater number of patients are needed to validate this result.",36586323.txt,1
24374145,"Phase I evaluation of XL019, an oral, potent, and selective JAK2 inhibitor.","This phase I study evaluated selective JAK2 inhibitor XL019 in 30 patients with myelofibrosis. The initial dose cohorts were 100, 200, and 300 mg orally on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. Central and/or peripheral neurotoxicity developed in all patients. Subsequently, patients were treated on lower doses; neurotoxicity was again observed, leading to study termination. Peripheral neuropathy resolved in 50%, and central neurotoxicity in all patients within months after therapy cessation. Myelosuppression was minimal.

28423318,Oligodendrocyte Nf1 Controls Aberrant Notch Activation and Regulates Myelin Structure and Behavior.,"The RASopathy neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common autosomal dominant genetic disorders. In NF1 patients, neurological issues may result from damaged myelin, and mice with a neurofibromin gene (Nf1) mutation show white matter (WM) defects including myelin decompaction. Using mouse genetics, we find that altered Nf1 gene-dose in mature oligodendrocytes results in progressive myelin defects and behavioral abnormalities mediated by aberrant Notch activation. Blocking Notch, upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or nitric oxide signaling rescues myelin defects in hemizygous Nf1 mutants, and pharmacological gamma secretase inhibition rescues aberrant behavior with no effects in wild-type (WT) mice. Concomitant pathway inhibition rescues myelin abnormalities in homozygous mutants. Notch activation is also observed in Nf1+/- mouse brains, and cells containing active Notch are increased in NF1 patient WM. We thus identify Notch as an Nf1 effector regulating myelin structure and behavior in a RASopathy and suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling may be a therapeutic strategy for NF1.",28423318.txt,0
27103127,"Romiplostim in children with immune thrombocytopenia: a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.","BACKGROUND: The thrombopoietin receptor agonist romiplostim could be an effective treatment in symptomatic children with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia. We aimed to assess whether romiplostim is safe and effective in children with immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months' duration. METHODS: In this phase 3 double-blind study, eligible participants were children with immune thrombocytopenia aged 1 year to 17 years and mean platelet counts 30 x 10(9)/L or less (mean of two measurements during the screening period) with no single count greater than 35 x 10(9)/L, and were recruited from 27 sites in the USA, Canada, and Australia. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) through the interactive voice response system to receive weekly romiplostim or placebo for 24 weeks stratified by age (1 year to <6 years, 6 years to <12 years, 12 years to <18 years), adjusting the dose weekly from 1 mug/kg to 10 mug/kg to target platelet counts of 50-200 x 10(9)/L. Patients and investigators were blinded to the treatment assignment. The primary analysis included all randomised patients and the safety analysis included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of investigational product. The primary endpoint, durable platelet response, was defined as achievement of weekly platelet responses (platelet counts >=50 x 10(9)/L without rescue drug use in the preceding 4 weeks) in 6 or more of the final 8 weeks (weeks 18-25). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 01444417. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24, 2012, and Sept 3, 2014, 62 patients were randomly assigned; 42 to romiplostim and 20 to placebo. Durable platelet response was seen in 22 (52%) patients in the romiplostim group and two (10%) in the placebo group (p=0 002, odds ratio 9 1 [95% CI 1 9-43 2]). Durable platelet response rates with romiplostim by age were 38% (3/8) for 1 year to younger than 6 years, 56% (10/18) for 6 years to younger than 12 years, and 56% (9/16) for 12 years to younger than 18 years. One (5%) of 19 patients in the placebo group had serious adverse events compared with 10 (24%) of 42 patients in the romiplostim group. Of these serious adverse events, headache and thrombocytosis, in one (2%) of 42 patients in the romiplostim group, were considered treatment related. No patients withdrew due to adverse events. INTERPRETATION: In children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia, romiplostim induced a high rate of platelet response with no new safety signals. Ongoing romiplostim studies will provide further information as to long-term efficacy, safety, and remission in children with immune thrombocytopenia. FUNDING: Amgen Inc.",27103127.txt,0
30872385,Comparison of methodologies for the detection of BRAF mutations in bone marrow trephine specimens.,"AIMS: BRAF V600E detection assists in the diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia (HCL); however, testing practices vary. We evaluated the clinical utility of 5 BRAF mutation testing strategies for use on bone marrow trephines (BMT). METHODS: 11 HCL, 5 HCL 'mimic', 2 treated HCL and 10 normal BMT specimens were tested for mutant BRAF, comparing Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, amplicon-based next generation sequencing (NGS), automated (Idylla) PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: PCR and IHC were cheaper and identified V600E in 100 % of HCL cases. Pyrosequencing detected the mutation in 91%, NGS in 55% of cases and Sanger sequencing in 27%. All assays gave wild-type BRAF results in HCL mimics and normal BMT samples. CONCLUSIONS: PCR and IHC were most sensitive and cost-effective, but these have limited scope for multiplexing and are likely to be replaced by NGS gene panels or whole genome sequencing in the medium to long term.",30872385.txt,1
31296311,p53 major hotspot variants are associated with poorer prognostic features in hereditary cancer patients.,"TP53 pathogenic germline variation is associated with the multi-cancer predisposition Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Next-generation sequencing and multigene panel testing are highlighting variability in the clinical presentation of patients with TP53 positive results. We aimed to investigate if the p53 variants considered as major hotspots at both germline and somatic levels (p.Arg175His, p.Gly245Asp, p.Gly245Ser, p.Arg248Gln, p.Arg248Trp, p.Arg273Cys, p.Arg273His, and p.Arg282Trp) were associated with poorer prognostic features compared to other pathogenic missense variants in the DNA-binding domain. To do so, we assessed clinical features from 1025 carriers of germline TP53 pathogenic variants (749 probands and 276 relatives) from three independent datasets (IARC TP53 Database, Ambry Single Gene Testing, and Ambry Multigene Panel Testing). We observed that, compared to carriers of non-hotspot germline variants, individuals that carried a hotspot germline variant were more likely to present with a Classic LFS phenotype, earlier age of first breast cancer onset, and shorter time to diagnosis to any cancer. Further studies with larger datasets addressing differences in cancer phenotypes by genotype are thus needed to replicate our findings and consider variant effect and position, towards future personalized clinical management of pathogenic variant carriers.",31296311.txt,1
38041113,Development of a neutralization monoclonal antibody with a broad neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants has challenged the effectiveness of current therapeutic regimens. Here, we aimed to develop a potent SARS-CoV-2 antibody with broad neutralizing effect by screening a scFv library with the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) via phage display.
SKAI-DS84 was identified through phage display, and we performed pseudovirus neutralization assays, authentic virus neutralization assays, and in vivo neutralization efficacy evaluations. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was conducted to assess the physical characteristics of the antibody, including binding kinetics and measure its affinity for variant RBDs.
The selected clones were converted to human IgG, and among them, SKAI-DS84 was selected for further analyses based on its binding affinity with the variant RBDs. Using pseudoviruses, we confirmed that SKAI-DS84 was strongly neutralizing against wild-type, B.1.617.2, B.1.1.529, and subvariants of SARS-CoV-2. We also tested the neutralizing effect of SKAI-DS84 on authentic viruses, in vivo and observed a reduction in viral replication and improved lung pathology. We performed binding and epitope mapping experiments to understand the mechanisms underlying neutralization and identified quaternary epitopes formed by the interaction between RBDs as the target of SKAI-DS84.
We identified, produced, and tested the neutralizing effect of SKAI-DS84 antibody. Our results highlight that SKAI-DS84 could be a potential neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.",38041113.txt,0
30488427,Detection of KIT D816V in peripheral blood of children with manifestations of cutaneous mastocytosis suggests systemic disease.,"The use of allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction to identify KIT D816V in the peripheral blood of adults with mastocytosis has been reported to have value in the diagnosis, assessment of disease burden and management of this disease. To examine the value of this assay in children with cutaneous manifestations of mastocytosis, we assessed data on 65 patients with all variants of paediatric-onset mastocytosis, including those known to have systemic disease, to correlate KIT mutation status with clinical findings, serum tryptase levels and bone marrow histopathology. We found that KIT D816V was not identified in the peripheral blood of children known to have only cutaneous disease (specificity 100%) but was found in those known to have both cutaneous and systemic/probable systemic disease (sensitivity of 85 2%). These findings were the basis of the development of an algorithm to assist in the decision for when to perform a bone marrow biopsy in children presenting with cutaneous manifestations of mastocytosis.",30488427.txt,0
30910249,"Molecular markers in recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancers.","OBJECTIVES: Stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancers have low recurrence rates and often do not receive adjuvant therapy. We compared recurrent cases to matched non-recurrent controls to evaluate for molecular markers associated with higher risk of recurrence. METHODS: A case-control study including all cases of recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer at one institution in a ten-year period. Cases were matched to controls by age, BMI, weight and stage. Molecular testing and immunohistochemistry were performed on archival tumor specimens: microsatellite instability (MSI-H), mismatch repair status, POLE mutational status, and next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: 15 stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancer cases with recurrent disease and available tumor specimens were identified. CTNNB1 and MSI-H were present at significantly higher rates in cases than controls (CTNNB1 60% vs. 28%, OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.1-14.7, p = 0.04 and MSI-H 53% vs. 21%, OR 4.4, 95%CI 1.1-17.0, p = 0.03). POLE mutations were found in 0% of cases vs. 7% of controls (p = 0.54). Among specimens demonstrating microsatellite stability (MSS), 100% of cases vs. 26% of controls had CTNNB1 mutations (p < 0.001). CTNNB1 wild type tumors were MSI-H in 100% of cases vs. 19% of controls (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to controls, CTNNB1 mutation is present at significantly higher rates in recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancers and is found most commonly in MSS tumors. MSI-H is also present at significantly higher rates in recurrent cases. These markers may be useful for prognostic risk stratification and adjuvant therapy decision-making in this otherwise low-risk population.",30910249.txt,1
30820047,"Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer's disease identifies new risk loci and implicates Abeta, tau, immunity and lipid processing.","Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Abeta processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 x 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.",30820047.txt,0
31009132,Frequency of isolated cutaneous involvement in adult mastocytosis: a cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is characterized by the accumulation/proliferation of abnormal mast cells. The frequency of isolated cutaneous involvement in adults with mastocytosis has not been fully determined. The main objective of our study was to assess the frequency of isolated cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) in adults with mastocytosis skin lesions. The second objective was to compare the clinical, histological, biological and imaging features in patients with isolated CM and patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM). METHODS: We included all patients with histology-proven mastocytosis skin lesions between January 2009 and December 2017. The mastocytosis diagnosis was made according to the international diagnostic criteria. All data were collected from a dedicated specific case report. RESULTS: Among 160 patients with mastocytosis skin lesions, 25 patients had isolated CM (15.6%), 105 had SM and 30 (18.7%) patients had undetermined mastocytosis. Skin KIT mutation (OR: 51.9, 95% CI: 3.9-678, P = 0.001) and high bone marrow tryptase (OR: 97.4, 95% CI: 10.3-915, P = 0.001) were strong predictors of SM. The prevalence of osteoporosis was higher in the SM population than in the isolated CM population. Moreover, a decrease in bone mineral density over a short period of follow-up (1-2 years) was associated with SM. There were no differences between the two groups regarding the frequency of mast cell activation symptoms, the presentation of skin lesions, the number of mast cells in the dermis and the level of serum tryptase. We propose considering the KIT mutation status and bone marrow tryptase levels to aid the diagnosis of isolated CM in adult mastocytosis patients. CONCLUSION: Only a small minority of adults with mastocytosis skin lesions has isolated cutaneous involvement. In 18.7% of mastocytosis cases, even complete workup does not allow for a precise classification of patients.",31009132.txt,0
37394163,An improved recombinase polymerase amplification assay for the visual detection of Staphylococcus epidermidis with lateral flow strips.,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogenic microorganism that is an important cause of cross-infection in hospitals. The development of rapid and effective detection techniques is important for its control. The application of traditional identification and PCR-based methods is limited by their requirements for both laboratory instrumentation and trained personnel. To overcome this issue, we developed a fast detection approach for S. epidermidis that was based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and lateral flow strips (LFS). First, five pairs of primers were designed for molecular diagnosis using the sesB gene as the target, and were screened for their amplification performance and the formation of primer dimers. Specific probes were then designed based on the best primer pairs screened, which were susceptible to primer-dependent artifacts and generated false-positive signals when used for LFS detection. This weakness of the LFS assay was overcome by modifying the sequences of the primers and probes. The efficacy of these measures was rigorously tested, and improved the RPA-LFS system. Standardized systems completed the amplification process within 25 min at a constant temperature of 37°C, followed by visualization of the LFS within 3 min. The approach was very sensitive (with a detection limit of 8.91 CFU/μL), with very good interspecies specificity. In the analysis of clinical samples, the approach produced results consistent with PCR and 97.78% consistent with the culture-biochemical method, with a kappa index of 0.938. Our method was rapid, accurate, and less dependent on equipment and trained personnel than traditional methods, and provided information for the timely development of rational antimicrobial treatment plans. It has high potential utility in clinical settings, particularly in resource-constrained locations.",37394163.txt,0
30998136,[Mutation Spectrum of FANCJ Gene in Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia].,"OBJECTIVE: To detect and analyze the mutation status of FANCJ gene in adult AML patients, so as to provide the basis for studying the mechanism of FANCJ driven AML and guiding the preventim and treatment of deseese. METHODS: The cDNAs were extracted and transeripted from bone marrow cells and normal skin cells in 222 newly diagnosed AML patients. The primers were designed for FANCJ gene coding region, the mutations of FANCJ gene coding region in AML patients as well as the mutations of FANCJ gene in mucous membrane epethelia in patients were detected by PCR and sanger seguencing; the evolutionary conservation of FANCJ mutation in different organisms was analyzed by NCBI Blast online bioinformaties software. RESULTS: The sequencing analysis showed that the mutations of FANCJ gene happened in 11 sites of FANCJ gene coding region, which were as followed: exon5:c.G430A:p.A144T, exon6:c.A587G:pN196S, exon9:c.C1255T:p.R419W, exon10:c.G1442A:p.G481D, exon11:c.C1609G:p.L537V, exon16:c.C2360T:p.P787L, exon17:c.C2440T:p.R814C, exon19:c.C2608T:pH870Y, exon19:c.A2686G:p.I896V, exon19:c.C2830G:p.Q944E, exon20:c.G3412A:p.D1138N. Among them, the repeatability existed in mutations of A144T, N196S, R814C, I896V and Q944E. Beside, the mutation sites of A144, R419, G381, L537, P787, H870, Q944 and D1138 were highly conserved in different organisms. CONCLUSION: Among 222 adult AML patients, the mutations of FANCJ gene have been found in 26 patients, moreover, the mutation sites are relatively conserved in different organisms, and possess important fanction. The results of this study provide the basis for exploring the mexhanism of FANCJ gene driven AML and for guiding the prevantion and treatment of AML.",30998136.txt,1

30942566,Label-Free Electrochemical Sensor for CD44 by Ligand-Protein Interaction.,"Detection of biomarkers in biosystems plays a key role in advanced biodiagnostics for research and clinical use. Design of new analytical platforms is challenging and in demand, addressing molecular capture and subsequent quantitation. Herein, we developed a label-free electrochemical sensor for CD44 by ligand-protein interaction. We assembled carbon nanotube composites on the electrode to enhance electronic conductivity by 6.2-fold and reduce overpotential with a shift of 77 mV. We conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA) to the surface of carbon nanotubes via electrostatic interaction between HA and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA). Consequently, we performed direct electrochemical sensing of CD44 with a dynamic range of 0.01-100 ng/mL and detection limit of 5.94 pg/mL without any postlabeling for amplification, comparable to the best current results. The sensor also displayed high selectivity, reproducibility with relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 5) of 2.57%, and long-term stability for 14 days. We demonstrated applications of the sensor in detection of human serum and cancer cells. Our work guides the development of more sensor types by ligand-protein interactions and contributes to design of interfaces in given biosystems for diagnosis.",30942566.txt,1
36380563,The effect of EGFR-TKIs on survival in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations: A real-world study.,"Few large-scale studies have been published using real-world data related to overall survival (OS) improvements in advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung cancer patients; therefore, little is known regarding the characteristics of patients who could benefit most from EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Our study aimed to assess whether EGFR-TKI treatment confers survival benefits among advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR mutations in the Chinese population.
A total of 6451 advanced NSCLC patients were diagnosed between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2019 in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. Ultimately, 2864 patients with a confirmed EGFR mutation genotype were enrolled in our study. OS was measured from the time of diagnosis of advanced NSCLC until death or last follow-up.
Median follow-up for OS of advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients was 28.33 months in our study. Patients who received EGFR-TKIs demonstrated better survival compared to those without EGFR-TKI treatment (mOS: 29.77 vs. 22.97 months, p < 0.0001). A total of 451 patients switched to third-generation EGFR-TKI treatment and obtained a significantly better survival than those who adopted first-line third-generation EGFR-TKIs or those who did not receive third-generation EGFR-TKIs after disease progression with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI treatment (mOS: 38.0 vs. 32.5 vs. 28.3 months, p < 0.0001). As for EGFR genotypes, patients with exon 19 deletion showed better OS, followed by those with L858R mutation (32.4 vs. 24.83 months, p = 0.0013). NGS versus PCR testing showed no statistical differences with respect to survival outcomes (mOS: 27.5 vs. 27.47 months, p = 0.6745).

31092450,Role of Amino Acid Transporter Expression as a Prognostic Marker in Patients With Surgically Resected Colorectal Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is highly expressed in various human cancers. However, the clinicopathological significance of LAT1 and 4F2 cell surface antigen (4F2hc) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the prognostic significance of LAT1 expression in CRC patients who underwent surgical resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from one hundred and forty-seven patients were examined by immunohistochemistry. The expression of LAT1 and 4F2hc, and the Ki-67 labeling index were assessed using resected tumor specimens. RESULTS: The positive expression of LAT1 and 4F2c was 80% (118/147) and 58% (86/147) (p<0.01), respectively. The expression of LAT1 was identified as an independent significant marker linked to worse prognosis in patients with CRC, and was correlated with tumor cell proliferation, tumor aggressiveness, and metastasis. Moreover, LAT1 was closely associated with the expression of 4F2hc and phosphorylation of the mTOR pathway. CONCLUSION: LAT1 is a significant molecular marker used to predict prognosis after surgical resection of CRC patients.",31092450.txt,1
28604711,The anaphase promoting complex impacts repair choice by protecting ubiquitin signalling at DNA damage sites.,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired through two major pathways, homology-directed recombination (HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). While HDR can only occur in S/G2, NHEJ can happen in all cell cycle phases (except mitosis). How then is the repair choice made in S/G2 cells? Here we provide evidence demonstrating that APCCdh1 plays a critical role in choosing the repair pathways in S/G2 cells. Our results suggest that the default for all DSBs is to recruit 53BP1 and RIF1. BRCA1 is blocked from being recruited to broken ends because its recruitment signal, K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains on histones, is actively destroyed by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1. We show that the removal of USP1 depends on APCCdh1 and requires Chk1 activation known to be catalysed by ssDNA-RPA-ATR signalling at the ends designated for HDR, linking the status of end processing to RIF1 or BRCA1 recruitment.",28604711.txt,0
36960434,Pediatric Nemaline Myopathy: A Systematic Review Using Individual Patient Data.,"Nemaline myopathy is a skeletal muscle disease that affects 1 in 50 000 live births. The objective of this study was to develop a narrative synthesis of the findings of a systematic review of the latest case descriptions of patients with NM. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using the keywords <i>pediatric</i>, <i>child</i>, <i>NM</i>, <i>nemaline rod</i>, and <i>rod myopathy</i>. Case studies focused on pediatric NM and published in English between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020, in order to represent the most recent findings. Information was collected about the age of first signs, earliest presenting neuromuscular signs and symptoms, systems affected, progression, death, pathologic description, and genetic changes. Of a total of 385 records, 55 case reports or series were reviewed, covering 101 pediatric patients from 23 countries. We review varying presentations in children ranging in severity despite being caused by the same mutation, in addition to current and future clinical considerations relevant to the care of patients with NM. This review synthesizes genetic, histopathologic, and disease presentation findings from pediatric NM case reports. These data strengthen our understanding of the wide spectrum of disease seen in NM. Future studies are needed to identify the underlying molecular mechanism of pathology, to improve diagnostics, and to develop better methods to improve the quality of life for these patients.",36960434.txt,0
31177126,Targeted Genomic Sequencing Reveals Novel TP53 In-frame Deletion Mutations Leading to p53 Overexpression in High-grade Serous Tubo-ovarian Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common histological subtype of ovarian carcinoma. Somatic mutation of tumor protein 53 (TP53) is a hallmark of tubo-ovarian HGSC and is observed in almost all such cases. Highly sensitive targeted genomic sequencing can be used to identify novel mutations that may become potential druggable targets and aid in therapeutic decisions. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of HGSCs with novel somatic TP53 mutations identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A commercial NGS panel comprising 170 genes, including TP53, was used to analyze the genetic profiles of 132 ovarian carcinoma cases. The clinicopathological characteristics and p53 immunostaining results of two HGSCs exhibiting novel TP53 mutations were investigated. RESULTS: Eighty-eight (66.7%) out of 132 ovarian carcinoma cases were diagnosed as HGSC. Novel TP53 in-frame deletion mutations c.719_727delGTTCCTGCA (p53 p.Ser240_Cys242del) and c.634_642delTTTCGACAT (p53 p.F212_H214del) were detected in a single case of HGSC each. Both patients were postmenopausal women. Imaging and laboratory studies revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis and elevated levels of serum tumor markers. The patients underwent primary debulking surgery and were diagnosed as having stage IIIC HGSC. In both cases, p53 immunostaining revealed uniform nuclear immunoreactivity in 90% or more of tumor cells at a very strong intensity. CONCLUSION: Targeted genomic sequencing revealed novel in-frame deletion mutations of TP53 leading to p53 overexpression in tubo-ovarian HGSC. This discovery of previously unreported somatic TP53 mutations provides insight into the translation of NGS technology into personalized medicine and identifies new potential targets for therapeutic applications.",31177126.txt,1
29760532,Apoptotic cell-induced AhR activity is required for immunological tolerance and suppression of systemic lupus erythematosus in mice and humans.,"The transcription factor AhR modulates immunity at multiple levels. Here we report that phagocytes exposed to apoptotic cells exhibited rapid activation of AhR, which drove production of the cytokine IL-10. Activation of AhR was dependent on interactions between apoptotic-cell DNA and the pattern-recognition receptor TLR9 that was required for the prevention of immune responses to DNA and histones in vivo. Moreover, disease progression in mouse systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) correlated with strength of the AhR signal, and the disease course could be altered by modulation of AhR activity. Deletion of AhR in the myeloid lineage caused systemic autoimmunity in mice, and an enhanced AhR transcriptional signature correlated with disease in patients with SLE. Thus, AhR activity induced by apoptotic cell phagocytes maintains peripheral tolerance.",29760532.txt,0
25488918,BRCA2 diffuses as oligomeric clusters with RAD51 and changes mobility after DNA damage in live cells.,"Genome maintenance by homologous recombination depends on coordinating many proteins in time and space to assemble at DNA break sites. To understand this process, we followed the mobility of BRCA2, a critical recombination mediator, in live cells at the single-molecule level using both single-particle tracking and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. BRCA2-GFP and -YFP were compared to distinguish diffusion from fluorophore behavior. Diffusive behavior of fluorescent RAD51 and RAD54 was determined for comparison. All fluorescent proteins were expressed from endogenous loci. We found that nuclear BRCA2 existed in oligomeric clusters, and exhibited heterogeneous mobility. DNA damage increased BRCA2 transient binding, presumably including binding to damaged sites. Despite its very different size, RAD51 displayed mobility similar to BRCA2, which indicates physical interaction between these proteins both before and after induction of DNA damage. We propose that BRCA2-mediated sequestration of nuclear RAD51 serves to prevent inappropriate DNA interactions and that all RAD51 is delivered to DNA damage sites in association with BRCA2.",25488918.txt,0
36930129,Rectum adenocarcinoma metabolic subtypes analysis and a risk prognostic model construction based on fatty acid metabolism genes.,"Fatty acid metabolism is an essential part of cancer research due to its role in cancer initiation and progression. However, its characteristics and prognostic value in rectum adenocarcinoma have not been systematically evaluated. We collected fatty acid metabolism gene expression profiles and clinical information from the cancer genome atlas and gene expression omnibus databases. After excluding individuals lacking clinical information and the presence of genetic mutations, we performed consistent clustering of the remaining patients and selected stable clustering results to group patients. Differentially expressed genes and gene set enrichment analysis were compared between subgroups, while metabolic signature identification and decoding the tumor microenvironment were performed. In addition, we explored the survival status of patients among different subgroups and identified signature genes affecting survival by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Finally, we selected signature genes to construct a risk prognostic model by multivariate Cox regression and evaluated model efficacy by univariate Cox regression and the receiver operating characteristic curve. By consensus clustering, patients were distinguished into 2 stable subpopulations, gene set enrichment analysis and metabolic signature identification effectively defined 2 completely different subtypes of fatty acid metabolism: fatty acid catabolic subtype and fatty acid anabolic subtype. Among them, patients with the fatty acid catabolic subtype had a poorer prognosis, with a significantly lower proportion of myeloid dendritic cells infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. Aquaporin 7 (hazard ratio, HR = 2.064 (1.4408-4.5038); P < .01), X inactive specific transcript (HR = (0.3758-0.7564), P = .045) and interleukin 4 induced 1 (HR = 1.34 (1.13-1.59); P = .034), were selected by multivariate Cox regression, which constructed a risk prognostic model. The independent hazard ratio of the model was 2.72 and the area under curve was higher than age, gender and tumor stage, showing better predictive efficacy. Our study revealed the heterogeneity of fatty acid metabolism in rectum adenocarcinoma, defined 2 completely distinct subtypes of fatty acid metabolism, and finally established a novel fatty acid metabolism-related risk prognostic model. The study contributes to the early risk assessment and monitoring of individual prognosis and provides data to support individualized patient treatment.",36930129.txt,1
31571071,Optimized immunohistochemical detection of estrogen receptor beta using two validated monoclonal antibodies confirms its expression in normal and malignant breast tissues.,"PURPOSE: Significant controversy exists regarding the expression patterns of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) in normal and diseased breast tissue. To address this issue, we have validated two ERbeta antibodies, optimized the IHC protocols for both antibodies and now report the expression patterns of ERbeta in normal and malignant breast tissues. METHODS: ERbeta antibody specificity was determined using western blot and IHC analysis. ERbeta protein expression patterns were assessed via IHC in normal breast tissue and invasive breast carcinoma. Further, we report the detailed protocol of the ERbeta IHC assay developed in our CAP/CLIA certified laboratory to provide a standardized method for future studies. RESULTS: We have confirmed the specificity of two independent ERbeta monoclonal antibodies, one that detects total (i.e., full length plus splice variants 2-5, which do not include the ligand binding domain) ERbeta protein (PPZ0506) and one that detects only the full-length form, which includes the ligand binding domain, of ERbeta (PPG5/10). Using these two antibodies, we demonstrate that ERbeta is highly expressed in normal human breast tissue as well as in 20-30% of invasive breast cancers. Further, these two antibodies exhibited similar staining patterns across multiple different tissues and were highly concordant with regard to determining ERbeta positivity in breast cancers. CONCLUSIONS: ERbeta protein was shown to be abundant in the majority of normal breast epithelial cells and is present in 20-30% of breast cancers. Use of these two antibodies, along with their standardized IHC protocols, provide a reference for future studies aimed at determining the utility of ERbeta as a prognostic and/or predictive biomarker in various tissues of benign or malignant states.",31571071.txt,1

Bone marrow analysis constitutes the most appropriate site for screening systemic involvement in mastocytosis. Morphologic, immunohistochemical, flow cytometric immunophenotyping, and molecular studies should be routinely performed for diagnostic/prognostic purposes in experienced reference centers during the diagnostic workup in suspected systemic mastocytosis.

31335885,Telomere length and its correlation with gene mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a Korean population.,"Telomere length (TL) is a prognostic indicator in Caucasian chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but its significance in Asian CLL remains unknown. To investigate the prognostic significance of TL and its correlation with cytogenetic aberrations and somatic mutations, we analyzed TL measurements at the cellular level by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in patients with CLL in Korea. The present study enrolled 110 patients (41 females and 69 males) diagnosed with CLL according to the World Health Organization criteria (2001-2017). TLs of bone marrow nucleated cells at the single-cell level were measured by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) in 71 patients. The correlations of TL with clinical characteristics, cytogenetic aberrations, genetic mutations, and overall survival were assessed. The median value of mean TL in CLL patients (T/C ratio 7.46 (range 1.19-18.14) was significantly shorter than that in the normal controls (T/C ratio 15.28 (range 8.59-24.93) (p < 0.001). Shorter TLs were associated with complex karyotypes (p = 0.030), del(11q22) (p = 0.023), presence of deletion and/or mutation in ATM and/or TP53 (p = 0.019), and SH2B3 mutation (p = 0.015). A shorter TL was correlated with lower hemoglobin levels and adverse survival (mean TL < 9.35, p = 0.021). When the proportion of cells with extremely short TLs (< 7.61) was greater than 90%, CLL patients showed poor survival (p = 0.002). Complex karyotypes, TP53 mutation, and the number of mutated genes were determined to be significant adverse variables by multivariable Cox analysis (p = 0.011, p = 0.002, and p = 0.002, respectively). TL was attrited in CLL, and attrited telomeres were correlated with adverse survival and other well-known adverse prognostic factors. We infer that TL is an independent adverse prognostic predictor in Korean CLL.",31335885.txt,1
29948574,T+ NK+ IL-2 Receptor gamma Chain Mutation: a Challenging Diagnosis of Atypical Severe Combined Immunodeficiency.,"PURPOSE: All reported patients with hypomorphic X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) due to c.664C>T (p.R222C) mutations in the gene (IL2RG) encoding the common gamma chain (gammac) have presented with opportunistic infections within the first year of life, despite the presence of nearly normal NK and T cell numbers. Reporting five children of one extended family with hemizygous mutations in IL2RG, we explore potential diagnostic clues and extend our comprehension of the functional impact of this mutation. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES); detailed immune phenotyping; cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation; B, T, and NK cell activation; and quantification of sjTRECs in five Arab children with c.664C>T (p.R222C) IL2RG mutation. RESULTS: The mean age at clinical presentation with respiratory tract infection or diarrhea was 6.8 (range: 2-12) months. None of the children presented with opportunistic infections. Diagnostic clues were early onset in the first year of life, and a suggestive family history associated with reduced naive CD4 T cells and absent switched memory B cells. Number and phenotype of NK cells and innate-like lymphocytes were normal. The diagnosis was made by WES and corroborated by absent STAT phosphorylation and reduced functional response after IL-2 and IL-21 stimulation. Four patients underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: As early diagnosis and treatment are important, a high index of suspicion in the diagnosis of c.664C>T (p.R222C) X-SCID is needed. This requires prompt genetic testing by next generation sequencing in order to avoid unnecessary delays in the definite diagnosis since immunological work up may not be discriminating. Assays directly testing cytokine signaling or cytokine-dependent functions are helpful in confirming the functional impact of the identified hypomorphic variants.",29948574.txt,0
24200965,Dynamics of histone H3.3 deposition in proliferating and senescent cells reveals a DAXX-dependent targeting to PML-NBs important for pericentromeric heterochromatin organization.,"Oncogene-induced senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest characterized by extensive chromatin reorganization. Here, we investigated the specific targeting and dynamics of histone H3 variants in human primary senescent cells. We show that newly synthesized epitope-tagged H3.3 is incorporated in senescent cells but does not accumulate in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF). Instead, we observe that new H3.3 colocalizes with its specific histone chaperones within the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and is targeted to PML-NBs in a DAXX-dependent manner both in proliferating and senescent cells. We further show that overexpression of DAXX enhances targeting of H3.3 in large PML-NBs devoid of transcriptional activity and promotes the accumulation of HP1, independently of H3K9me3. Loss of H3.3 from pericentromeric heterochromatin upon DAXX or PML depletion suggests that the targeting of H3.3 to PML-NBs is implicated in pericentromeric heterochromatin organization. Together, our results underline the importance of the replication-independent chromatin assembly pathway for histone replacement in non-dividing senescent cells and establish PML-NBs as important regulatory sites for the incorporation of new H3.3 into chromatin.",24200965.txt,0
36841040,The potential of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway inhibitors in ovarian cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway plays a role in ovarian carcinogenesis. Low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC) frequently harbors activating MAPK mutations. MAPK inhibitors have been used in small subsets of ovarian carcinoma (OC) patients to control tumor growth. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of MAPK inhibitors in OC patients. We aimed to determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR), the subgroup of MAPK inhibitors with the best CBR and overall response rate (ORR), and the most common adverse events.
We conducted a search in PubMed, Embase via Ovid, the Cochrane library and clinicaltrials.gov on studies evaluating the efficacy of single MAPK pathway inhibition with MAPK pathway inhibitors in OC patients. Our primary outcome included the CBR, defined by the proportion of patients with stable disease (SD), complete (CR) and partial response (PR). Secondary outcomes included the ORR (including PR and CR) and grade 3 and 4 adverse events. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.
We included nine studies with a total of 319 OC patients, for which we determined a pooled CBR of 63% (95%-CI 39-84%, I<sup>2</sup> = 92%). Combined treatment with Raf- and MEK inhibitors in in BRAF<sup>v600</sup> mutated LGSOC (n = 6) had the greatest efficacy with a CBR of 100% and ORR of 83%. MEK inhibitors had the best efficacy as a single agent. Subgroup analysis by tumor histology demonstrated a significantly higher CBR and ORR in patients with LGSOC, with a pooled CBR and ORR of 87% (95%-CI 81-92%, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) and 27% (95%-CI 10-48%, I<sup>2</sup> = 77%) respectively. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported frequently: 123 in 167 patients.
MEK inhibitors are the most promising single agents in (LGS)OC. However, dual MAPK pathway inhibition should be considered in patients with a BRAF<sup>v600</sup> mutation, or non-mutated OC with depleted treatment options due indications of higher efficacy and tolerable toxicity profiles.",36841040.txt,1
31048353,"Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions.","Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by dysplasia, abnormal production and accumulation of monocytic cells and an elevated risk of transforming into acute leukemia. Over the past two decades, our knowledge about the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms in CMML has increased substantially. In parallel, better diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies have been developed. However, many questions remain regarding prognostication and optimal therapy. In addition, there is a need to define potential pre-phases of CMML and special CMML variants, and to separate these entities from each other and from conditions mimicking CMML. To address these unmet needs, an international consensus group met in a Working Conference in August 2018 and discussed open questions and issues around CMML, its variants, and pre-CMML conditions. The outcomes of this meeting are summarized herein and include diag nostic criteria and a proposed classification of pre-CMML conditions as well as refined minimal diagnostic criteria for classical CMML and special CMML variants, including oligomonocytic CMML and CMML associated with systemic mastocytosis. Moreover, we propose diagnostic standards and tools to distinguish between 'normal', pre-CMML and CMML entities. These criteria and standards should facilitate diagnostic and prognostic evaluations in daily practice and clinical studies in applied hematology.",31048353.txt,1
31243107,STK11 p.G270W: A Novel Mutation Detected in a Case of MSI High Mixed Medullary-Mucinous Carcinoma of the Transverse Colon.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: To report a case of mixed medullary/mucinous adenocarcinoma with unusual mutational gene profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 79-year-old female was diagnosed with a colorectal carcinoma of the transverse colon. The diagnostic work-up of this case included thorough clinicopathological evaluation, immunohistochemistry and next generation Sequencing. RESULTS: The clinicopathological evaluation showed a tumor with morphological features of both medullary and mucinous colorectal carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed the loss of DNA mismatch repair proteins. NGS showed that the medullary component of this tumor had a novel STK11 p.G270W mutation, which was not present in the mucinous component. Both the medullary and mucinous components also had BRAF V600E and AKT1 (pE17K) mutations. CONCLUSION: We report a novel mutation STK11 (p.G270W), in medullary carcinoma of the colon with an associated mucinous component.",31243107.txt,1
36738086,Genomic and proteomic characterization of Philadelphia-like B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A report of Indian patients.,"The gold standard for the identification of Philadelphia (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients is gene expression profiling. Because of its diverse nature, its identification is extremely difficult and expensive. On the genomic and proteomic landscape of Ph-like ALL patients, there is a paucity of published literature from developing countries.
The authors used digital barcoded nCounter NanoString gene expression profiling for its detection, followed by molecular and proteomic characterization using fluorescence in situ hybridization and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
The authors found 32.05% Ph-like ALL patients and their median age at presentation was considerably higher than Ph-negative ALL cases (p = .0306). Furthermore, we identified 20% CRLF2 overexpressed cases having 8.33% CRLF2-IGH translocation with concomitant R683S mutation and 8.33% CRLF2-P2RY8 translocation. In 80% of CRLF2 downregulated cases, we identified 10% as having JAK2 rearrangement. Minimal residual disease-positivity was more common in Ph-like ALL cases (55.55% vs. 25% in Ph-negative ALL cases). Immunoglobulin J chain (Jchain), small nuclear ribonucleoprotein SmD1 (SNRPD1), immunoglobulin κ constant (IGKC), NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 α subcomplex subunit 2 (NDUFA2), histone H2AX (H2AFX), charged multivesicular body protein 4b (CHMP4B), and carbonyl reductase (NADPH) (CBR1) proteins were identified to be substantially expressed in Ph-like ALL patients, using LC-MS/MS. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that involvement of spliceosomal mediated messenger RNA splicing pathway and four microRNAs was statistically significant in Ph-like ALL patients.
For the first time, we have described incidence, molecular, and proteomic characterization of Ph-like ALL, in developing nations.
In developing countries, detecting Philadelphia (Ph)-like B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia is complicated and challenging due to its diverse genetic landscape. There is no well-defined and cost-effective methodology for its detection. The incidence of this high-risk subtype is very high in adult cases, and there is an urgent need for its accurate detection. We have developed an online PHi-RACE classifier for its rapid detection, followed by delineating the genomic and proteomic landscape of Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemias for the first time in Indian patients.",36738086.txt,1
36989883,Implementation of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency testing in Europe.,"The main cause for fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity is deficiency of the metabolizing enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). In 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended two methods for pre-treatment DPD deficiency testing in clinical practice: phenotyping using endogenous uracil concentration or genotyping for DPYD risk variant alleles. This study assessed the DPD testing implementation status in Europe before (2019) and after (2021) the release of the EMA recommendations.
The survey was conducted from 16 March 2022 to 31 July 2022. An electronic form with seven closed and three open questions was e-mailed to 251 professionals with DPD testing expertise of 34 European countries. A descriptive analysis was conducted.
We received 79 responses (31%) from 23 countries. Following publication of the EMA recommendations, 87% and 75% of the countries reported an increase in the amount of genotype and phenotype testing, respectively. Implementation of novel local guidelines was reported by 21 responders (27%). Countries reporting reimbursement of both tests increased in 2021, and only four (18%) countries reported no coverage for any testing type. In 2019, major implementation drivers were 'retrospective assessment of fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity' (39%), and in 2021, testing was driven by 'publication of guidelines' (40%). Although the major hurdles remained the same after EMA recommendations-'lack of reimbursement' (26%; 2019 versus 15%; 2021) and 'lack of recognizing the clinical relevance by medical oncologists' (25%; 2019 versus 8%; 2021)-the percentage of specialists citing these decreased. Following EMA recommendations, 25% of responders reported no hurdles at all in the adoption of the new testing practice in the clinics.
The EMA recommendations have supported the implementation of DPD deficiency testing in Europe. Key factors for successful implementation were test reimbursement and clear clinical guidelines. Further efforts to improve the oncologists' awareness of the clinical relevance of DPD testing in clinical practice are needed.",36989883.txt,0
31215130,Vocal cord inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor with mucoid deposits harboring TIMP3-ALK fusion: A potential diagnostic pitfall.,"A 35-year-old Japanese man who had experienced hoarseness for 10 years presented with a vocal cord lesion. A gross examination revealed a left vocal cord polyp occupying two-thirds of the vocal space. The endoscopically resected lesion contained scattered atypical fibroblastic, stellate, or ganglion-like cells with mucoid stroma. Vacuolated cells were also seen. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was largely undetectable. A vocal cord polyp was first suspected, but well-differentiated liposarcoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) were included in the differential diagnoses. The tumor cells were positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), calponin, and vimentin, and negative for other smooth muscle markers by immunohistochemistry. Structures resembling myofibroblasts were not observed by electron microscopy, which confirmed abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the tumor cells and accumulated lipid droplets in some tumor cells. ALK gene rearrangement was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and TIMP3-ALK fusion was confirmed by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. We diagnosed the lesion as an IMT, and an ALK-rearranged stellate cell tumor may be postulated. This is the first report of a fusion partner gene of ALK in a case of laryngeal IMT.",31215130.txt,1
31479144,Medication Use to Reduce Risk of Breast Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.,"Importance: Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death. The median age at diagnosis is 62 years, and an estimated 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. African American women are more likely to die of breast cancer compared with women of other races. Objective: To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on medications for risk reduction of primary breast cancer. Evidence Review: The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy of risk assessment methods to identify women who could benefit from risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, as well as evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of these medications. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic accuracy studies of risk stratification models in women without preexisting breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Findings: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk assessment tools can predict the number of cases of breast cancer expected to develop in a population. However, these risk assessment tools perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. The USPSTF found that the benefits of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk for breast cancer are no greater than small in women not at increased risk for the disease. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene and adequate evidence that aromatase inhibitors are associated with small to moderate harms. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the net benefit of taking medications to reduce risk of breast cancer is larger in women who have a greater risk for developing breast cancer. Conclusions and Recommendation: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, to women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against the routine use of risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, in women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer. (D recommendation) This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women 35 years and older, including women with previous benign breast lesions on biopsy (such as atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ). This recommendation does not apply to women who have a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.",31479144.txt,1
31181727,"ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common killer among men in Western countries. Targeting androgen receptor (AR) signaling by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the current therapeutic regime for patients newly diagnosed with metastatic PCa. However, most patients relapse and become resistant to ADT, leading to metastatic castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and eventually death. Several proposed mechanisms have been proposed for CRPC; however, the exact mechanism through which CRPC develops is still unclear. One possible pathway is that the AR remains active in CRPC cases. Therefore, understanding AR signaling networks as primary PCa changes into metastatic CRPC is key to developing future biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for PCa and CRPC. In the current review, we focused on three novel biomarkers (ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6) that were demonstrated to play critical roles in CRPC progression, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) drug resistance, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) for patients treated with ADT or AR inhibition. In addition, we summarize how these potential biomarkers can be used in the clinic for diagnosis and as therapeutic targets of PCa.",31181727.txt,1
31182807,The deubiquitinase Otub1 controls the activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells by regulating IL-15-mediated priming.,"CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are central cellular components of immune responses against pathogens and cancer, which rely on interleukin (IL)-15 for homeostasis. Here we show that IL-15 also mediates homeostatic priming of CD8+ T cells for antigen-stimulated activation, which is controlled by a deubiquitinase, Otub1. IL-15 mediates membrane recruitment of Otub1, which inhibits ubiquitin-dependent activation of AKT, a kinase that is pivotal for T cell activation and metabolism. Otub1 deficiency in mice causes aberrant responses of CD8+ T cells to IL-15, rendering naive CD8+ T cells hypersensitive to antigen stimulation characterized by enhanced metabolic reprograming and effector functions. Otub1 also controls the maturation and activation of NK cells. Deletion of Otub1 profoundly enhances anticancer immunity by unleashing the activity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. These findings suggest that Otub1 controls the activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells by functioning as a checkpoint of IL-15-mediated priming.",31182807.txt,1
26011312,Expression analysis of microRNA-125 in patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia and correlation with JAK2 allele burden and laboratory findings.,"INTRODUCTION: The JAK2V617F mutation has emerged in recent years as a diagnostic as well as a treatment target in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The disease phenotype is also influenced by other factors such as microRNA (miRNA) deregulation. The aim of this study was to investigate miR-125 expression level in these patients with those obtained from healthy control subjects and its correlation with JAK2 allele burden and laboratory findings. METHODS: In total, forty patients with a clinical diagnosis of PV and ET were examined at the time of diagnosis. Ten healthy subjects were checked as controls. We performed JAK2 V617F allele burdens measurement and expression analysis of miR-125b-5p, miR-125b-3p, miR-125a-5p, and miR-125a-3p in leukocytes isolated from peripheral blood by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: MiR-125b-5p and miR-125a-5p were upregulated in both patients with PV (P = 0.00 and P = 0.003, respectively) and ET (P = 0.02 and P = 0.002, respectively). In PV group, a significant correlation was observed between miR-125a-5p and platelet counts (P = 0.01, r = 0.531). The correlation between miRNA and JAk2 allele burden was not significant. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data indicate that other factors such as aberrant miR-125 expression may influence on the disease phenotype in patients with PV and ET.",26011312.txt,0
27216612,Everolimus improves neuropsychiatric symptoms in a patient with tuberous sclerosis carrying a novel TSC2 mutation.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by multiple symptoms including neuropsychological deficits such as seizures, intellectual disability, and autism. TSC is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which enhance activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Recent studies have suggested that mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin can reverse TSC-associated deficits in rodent models of TSC. In addition, clinical trials are ongoing to test the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors toward the psychiatric symptoms associated with TSC. Here, we report a case study of a Korean patient with TSC, who exhibited multiple symptoms including frequent seizures, intellectual disability, language delays, and social problems. We performed whole exome sequencing and identified a novel small deletion mutation in TSC2. Expressing the novel deletion mutant in HEK293T cells significantly increased mTOR pathway activation. Furthermore, everolimus treatment showed not only reduction in SEGA size, but dramatically improved behavioral deficits including autism related behaviors in the patient. In summary, we identified a novel small deletion mutation in TSC2 associated with severe TSC in a Korean family that enhances the activation of mTOR signaling in vitro. Everolimus treatment improved behavioral deficits in the patient.",27216612.txt,0
29519755,Osteopontin-deficient progenitor cells display enhanced differentiation to adipocytes.,"OBJECTIVE: Osteopontin (OPN, Spp1) is a protein upregulated in white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese subjects. Deletion of OPN protects mice from high-fat diet-induced WAT inflammation and insulin resistance. However, the alterations mediated by loss of OPN in WAT before the obesogenic challenge have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we hypothesised that the lack of OPN might enhance the pro-adipogenic micro environment before obesity driven inflammation. METHODS: OPN deficiency was tested in visceral (V) and subcutaneous (SC) WAT from WT and Spp1-/- female mice. Gene expression for hypoxia, inflammation and adipogenesis was checked in WT vs. Spp1-/- mice (n=15). Adipocytes progenitor cells (APC) were isolated by fluorescence cell sorting and role of OPN deficiency in adipogenesis was investigated by cell images and RT-PCR. RESULTS: We show that Spp1-/- maintained normal body and fat-pad weights, although hypoxia and inflammation markers were significantly reduced. In contrast, expression of genes involved in adipogenesis was increased in WAT from Spp1-/- mice. Strikingly, APC from Spp1-/- were diminished but differentiated more efficiently to adipocytes than those from control mice. CONCLUSIONS: APC from SC-WAT of lean OPN-deficient mice display an enhanced capacity for differentiating to adipocytes. These alterations may explain the healthy expansion of WAT in the OPN-deficient model which is associated with reduced inflammation and insulin resistance.",29519755.txt,0
31231679,SETER/PR: a robust 18-gene predictor for sensitivity to endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer.,"There is a clinical need to predict sensitivity of metastatic hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer to endocrine therapy, and targeted RNA sequencing (RNAseq) offers diagnostic potential to measure both transcriptional activity and functional mutation. We developed the SETER/PR index to measure gene expression microarray probe sets that were correlated with hormone receptors (ESR1 and PGR) and robust to preanalytical and analytical influences. We tested SETER/PR index in biopsies of metastastic HR+/HER2- breast cancer against the treatment outcomes in 140 patients. Then we customized the SETER/PR assay to measure 18 informative, 10 reference transcripts, and sequence the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ESR1 using droplet-based targeted RNAseq, and tested that in residual RNA from 53 patients. Higher SETER/PR index in metastatic samples predicted longer PFS and OS when patients received endocrine therapy as next treatment, even after adjustment for clinical-pathologic risk factors (PFS: HR 0.534, 95% CI 0.299 to 0.955, p = 0.035; OS: HR 0.315, 95% CI 0.157 to 0.631, p = 0.001). Mutated ESR1 LBD was detected in 8/53 (15%) of metastases, involving 1-98% of ESR1 transcripts (all had high SETER/PR index). A signature based on probe sets with good preanalytical and analytical performance facilitated our customization of an accurate targeted RNAseq assay to measure both phenotype and genotype of ER-related transcription. Elevated SETER/PR was associated with prolonged sensitivity to endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer, especially in the absence of mutated ESR1 transcript.",31231679.txt,1
31110352,Release of paused RNA polymerase II at specific loci favors DNA double-strand-break formation and promotes cancer translocations.,"It is not clear how spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) form and are processed in normal cells, and whether they predispose to cancer-associated translocations. We show that DSBs in normal mammary cells form upon release of paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at promoters, 5' splice sites and active enhancers, and are processed by end-joining in the absence of a canonical DNA-damage response. Logistic and causal-association models showed that Pol II pausing at long genes is the main predictor and determinant of DSBs. Damaged introns with paused Pol II-pS5, TOP2B and XRCC4 are enriched in translocation breakpoints, and map at topologically associating domain boundary-flanking regions showing high interaction frequencies with distal loci. Thus, in unperturbed growth conditions, release of paused Pol II at specific loci and chromatin territories favors DSB formation, leading to chromosomal translocations.",31110352.txt,1
31355228,Prognostic significance of the PANK family expression in acute myeloid leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogenous hematological malignancy and its prognostication depends on the genetic mutation and expression profile of each patient. Pantothenate kinase (PANK) is a regulatory enzyme that controls coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. It has four isoforms encoded by PANK1-4, respectively. Whether the expression of the PANK family has prognostic significance in AML remains unclear. METHODS: We screened The Cancer Genome Atlas database for AML patients with complete PANK1-4 expression data. Eighty-four AML patients met the criteria and were included in this study. Clinical characteristics at diagnosis, including peripheral blood (PB) white blood cell counts (WBC), blast percentages in PB and bone marrow (BM), French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and the frequencies of common genetic mutations were described. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were constructed for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), using a limited backward elimination procedure. RESULTS: Patients with high PANK2 expression had significantly longer event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with low PANK2 expression (P=0.007, P=0.016, respectively), whereas patients with high PANK4 expression had shorter EFS and OS than patients with low PANK4 expression (P=0.022, P=0.015, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that high PANK4 expression was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that high PANK2 expression might have favorable effects on AML, while high PANK4 expression was indicative of poor prognosis.",31355228.txt,1
25667416,Immunodeficiency and autoimmune enterocolopathy linked to NFAT5 haploinsufficiency.,"The link between autoimmune diseases and primary immunodeficiency syndromes has been increasingly appreciated. Immunologic evaluation of a young man with autoimmune enterocolopathy and unexplained infections revealed evidence of immunodeficiency, including IgG subclass deficiency, impaired Ag-induced lymphocyte proliferation, reduced cytokine production by CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and decreased numbers of NK cells. Genetic evaluation identified haploinsufficiency of NFAT5, a transcription factor regulating immune cell function and cellular adaptation to hyperosmotic stress, as a possible cause of this syndrome. Inhibition or deletion of NFAT5 in normal human and murine cells recapitulated several of the immune deficits identified in the patient. These results provide evidence of a primary immunodeficiency disorder associated with organ-specific autoimmunity linked to NFAT5 deficiency.",25667416.txt,0
31407494,"Risk stratification for lung adenocarcinoma on EGFR and TP53 mutation status, chemotherapy, and PD-L1 immunotherapy.","The overall survival rates for lung cancer remain unsatisfactorily low, even for patients with biomarkers for which target therapies or immunotherapies are recommended. Better identification of at-risk patients is needed to achieve more effective personalized treatment. Here, we derived a risk-stratifying gene signature consisting of five genes that had the greatest differential expression by stage from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) transcriptomes. The new gene signature enabled survival prognosis for multiple LUAD datasets from different platforms of transcriptomics and risk stratification for patients with and without a mutation in TP53 or EGFR, with high and low levels of PD-L1, and with and without adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Using these evaluations, it was also shown to be more robust compared to several other gene signatures. Functional analysis of the five genes and their protein-protein interaction partners indicated that they are functionally enriched in cell cycle, endocytosis, and EGFR regulation, which are biological processes associated with lung cancer and drug resistance. Extensive discussions on related experimental studies suggest that the five genes are novel and sensible targets for developing new drugs and/or tackling drug resistance problems for LUAD.",31407494.txt,1
29885404,In situ analysis of mTORC1/2 and cellular metabolism-related proteins in human Lymphangioleiomyomatosis.,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare progressive cystic lung disease with features of a low-grade neoplasm. It is primarily caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), slows down disease progression in some, but not all patients. Hitherto, other potential therapeutic targets such as mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and various metabolic pathways have not been investigated in human LAM tissues. The aim of this study was to assess activities of mTORC1, mTORC2 and various metabolic pathways in human LAM tissues through analysis of protein expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-S6 (mTORC1 downstream protein), Rictor (mTORC2 scaffold protein) as well as GLUT1, GAPDH, ATPB, GLS, MCT1, ACSS2 and CPT1A (metabolic pathway markers) were performed on lung tissue from 11 patients with sporadic LAM. Immunoreactivity was assessed in LAM cells with bronchial smooth muscle cells as controls. Expression of p-S6, Rictor, GAPDH, GLS, MCT1, ACSS2 and CPT1A was significantly higher in LAM cells than in bronchial smooth muscle cells (P<.01). No significant differences were found between LAM cells and normal bronchial smooth muscle cells in GLUT1 and ATPB expression. The results are uniquely derived from human tissue and indicate that, in addition to mTORC1, mTORC2 may also play an important role in the pathobiology of LAM. Furthermore, glutaminolysis, acetate utilization and fatty acid beta-oxidation appear to be the preferred bioenergetic pathways in LAM cells. mTORC2 and these preferred bioenergetic pathways appear worthy of further study as they may represent possible therapeutic targets in the treatment of LAM.",29885404.txt,0
25476696,Intestinal epithelial MyD88 is a sensor switching host metabolism towards obesity according to nutritional status.,"Obesity is associated with a cluster of metabolic disorders, low-grade inflammation and altered gut microbiota. Whether host metabolism is controlled by intestinal innate immune system and the gut microbiota is unknown. Here we report that inducible intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of MyD88 partially protects against diet-induced obesity, diabetes and inflammation. This is associated with increased energy expenditure, an improved glucose homeostasis, reduced hepatic steatosis, fat mass and inflammation. Protection is transferred following gut microbiota transplantation to germ-free recipients. We also demonstrate that intestinal epithelial MyD88 deletion increases anti-inflammatory endocannabinoids, restores antimicrobial peptides production and increases intestinal regulatory T cells during diet-induced obesity. Targeting MyD88 after the onset of obesity reduces fat mass and inflammation. Our work thus identifies intestinal epithelial MyD88 as a sensor changing host metabolism according to the nutritional status and we show that targeting intestinal epithelial MyD88 constitutes a putative therapeutic target for obesity and related disorders.",25476696.txt,0
30904095,The role of inherited genetic variants in colorectal polyposis syndromes.,"Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women across the world. Most CRCs occur sporadically, but in 15-35% of cases, hereditary factors are important. Some patients with an inherited predisposition to CRC will be diagnosed with a ""genetic polyposis syndrome"" such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), polymerase proofreading associated polyposis (PPAP), NTHL1-associated polyposis, MSH3-associated polyposis or a hamartomatous polyposis syndrome. Individuals with >=10 colorectal polyps have traditionally been referred for genetic diagnostic testing to identify APC and MUTYH mutations which cause FAP and MAP respectively. Mutations are found in most patients with >100 adenomas but in only a minority of those with 10-100 adenomas. The reasons that diagnostic laboratories are not identifying pathogenic variants include mutations occurring outside of the open reading frames of genes, individuals exhibiting generalized mosaicism and the involvement of additional genes. It is important to identify patients with an inherited polyposis syndrome, and to define the mutations causing their polyposis, so that the individuals and their relatives can be managed appropriately.",30904095.txt,1
27815897,Synchronization and Desynchronization of Cells by Interventions on the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint.,"Cell cycle checkpoints are surveillance mechanisms that sequentially and continuously monitor cell cycle progression thereby contributing to the preservation of genetic stability. Among them, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents the occurrence of abnormal divisions by halting the metaphase to anaphase transition following the detection of erroneous microtubules-kinetochore attachment(s). Most synchronization strategies are based on the activation of cell cycle checkpoints to enrich the population of cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle. Here, we develop a two-step protocol of sequential cell synchronization and desynchronization employing antimitotic SAC-inducing agents (i.e., nocodazole or paclitaxel) in combination with the depletion of the SAC kinase MPS1. We describe cytofluorometric and time-lapse videomicroscopy methods to detect cell cycle progression, including the assessment of cell cycle distribution, quantification of mitotic cell fraction, and analysis of single cell fate profile of living cells. We applied these methods to validate the synchronization-desynchronization protocol and to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the impact of SAC inactivation on the activity of antimitotic agents.",27815897.txt,0
29804876,Distant Insulin Signaling Regulates Vertebrate Pigmentation through the Sheddase Bace2.,"Patterning of vertebrate melanophores is essential for mate selection and protection from UV-induced damage. Patterning can be influenced by circulating long-range factors, such as hormones, but it is unclear how their activity is controlled in recipient cells to prevent excesses in cell number and migration. The zebrafish wanderlust mutant harbors a mutation in the sheddase bace2 and exhibits hyperdendritic and hyperproliferative melanophores that localize to aberrant sites. We performed a chemical screen to identify suppressors of the wanderlust phenotype and found that inhibition of insulin/PI3Kgamma/mTOR signaling rescues the defect. In normal physiology, Bace2 cleaves the insulin receptor, whereas its loss results in hyperactive insulin/PI3K/mTOR signaling. Insulin B, an isoform enriched in the head, drives the melanophore defect. These results suggest that insulin signaling is negatively regulated by melanophore-specific expression of a sheddase, highlighting how long-distance factors can be regulated in a cell-type-specific manner.",29804876.txt,0
31055940,A Pilot Low-Inflammatory Dietary Intervention to Reduce Inflammation and Improve Quality of Life in Patients With Familial Adenomatous Polyposis: Protocol Description and Preliminary Results.,"Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) depend on a lifelong endoscopic surveillance programme and prophylactic surgery, and usually suffer nutritional problems. Intestinal inflammation has been linked to both FAP and colorectal cancer. Epidemiological studies show a relationship between diet and inflammation. Preventive dietary recommendations for FAP patients are so far lacking. We have designed a nonrandomized prospective pilot study on FAP patients to assess whether a low-inflammatory diet based on the Mediterranean diet principles and recipes, by interacting with the microbiota, reduces gastrointestinal markers of inflammation and improves quality of life. This report describes the scientific protocol of the study and reports the participants' adherence to the proposed dietary recommendations. Thirty-four FAP patients older than 18 years, bearing the APC pathogenic variant, who underwent prophylactic total colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis were eligible into the study. During the 3-month dietary intervention, they reported improvements in their consumption of Mediterranean foods (vegetables, fruits, fish, and legumes), and a reduction in pro-inflammatory foods (red/processed meat and sweets); this led to a significant increase in their adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The improvement was accompanied by a decrease in the number of diarrhoeal discharges. These preliminary results are encouraging with regard to feasibility, dietary outcome measures, and safety.",31055940.txt,1
31351510,Giant Lumbar Polypoid Tumor with Bullae on its Surface.,"Dear Editor, Acrochordons are common benign neoplasms found in everyday practice. We present a rare case of a giant and single acrochordon on the lumbar region with signs of ischemia. The correlation of clinical, dermatoscopic, and histopathological analyses may help the clinician differentiate this entity from other benign and malignant dermatoses. A 33-year-old man presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of a lumbar mass that had been growing for two years. The lesion was asymptomatic except for recent discomfort when lying in the supine decubitus position. On examination there was a single, erythematous, non-tender pedunculated lesion, 5.1 cm x 4 cm x 3.2 cm in size, with flaccid bullae on its surface and firm consistency (Figure 1, a-b). Dermoscopy showed regularly arranged dotted vessels in a violaceous background and bullae filled with serous fluid (Figure 1, c-d). His personal and family medical history were unremarkable. Shave excision was performed and the sample was sent for histopathologic analysis. Histopathology revealed a normal epidermis surrounding a core of loose collagen fibers. Papillary dermis showed a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes. Scattered clusters of adipocytes were found in the deep dermis (Figure 2). The diagnosis of a giant ischemic acrochordon was established. Acrochordons, also commonly known as skin tags, are benign pedunculated neoplasms frequently found on the neck, axillae, or groin. They represent fibroepithelial polyps that originate from ectoderm and mesoderm tissue (1). They can be pigmented or skin colored and usually range between 2 to 5 mm in size. Skin tags can affect nearly 46% of the general population (2). Giant and solitary acrochordons are an uncommon clinical variant (2). Differential diagnosis of this pathology may be challenging in the particular clinical context of this patient. Benign neoplasms such as dermatofibroma, neurofibroma, and epidermal inclusion cysts can be clinically similar to giant skin tags (1,2). Histopathological analyses of acrochordons usually show papillomatosis, irregular acanthosis, loose collagen fibers, and dilated capillaries (2). A fibrolipomatous variant of acrochordon may reveal adipose tissue lobules between septa of collagen on pathological examination (1). Local ischemia due to twisting of the stalk may induce the formation of intradermal or subepidermal blisters in these tumors. Histopathologic characteristics found in ischemic acrochordons are neutrophil infiltration, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes (3). Fibroepithelioma of Pinkus (FeP) is a rare variant of basal cell carcinoma that may clinically mimic benign polypoid tumors and has a certain predilection for the lumbosacral area. Dermoscopic characteristics of fibroepithelioma of Pinkus that may aid the clinician in this diagnosis are fine arborizing vessels, either alone or associated with dotted vessels, and white streaks (4). Cosmetically adequate treatment of a giant acrochordon can be performed by shave excision and electrodesiccation of its pedicle. Choudhary et al. reported good results with this technique on a giant acrochordon on the thigh (5).",31351510.txt,1
30704988,Editing aberrant splice sites efficiently restores beta-globin expression in beta-thalassemia.,"The thalassemias are compelling targets for therapeutic genome editing in part because monoallelic correction of a subset of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) would be sufficient for enduring disease amelioration. A primary challenge is the development of efficient repair strategies that are effective in HSCs. Here, we demonstrate that allelic disruption of aberrant splice sites, one of the major classes of thalassemia mutations, is a robust approach to restore gene function. We target the IVS1-110G>A mutation using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and the IVS2-654C>T mutation by Cas12a/Cpf1 RNP in primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from beta-thalassemia patients. Each of these nuclease complexes achieves high efficiency and penetrance of therapeutic edits. Erythroid progeny of edited patient HSPCs show reversal of aberrant splicing and restoration of beta-globin expression. This strategy could enable correction of a substantial fraction of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia genotypes with currently available gene-editing technology.",30704988.txt,0
26775773,The spectrum of nephrocutaneous diseases and associations: Genetic causes of nephrocutaneous disease.,"There are a significant number of diseases and treatment considerations of considerable importance relating to the skin and renal systems. This emphasizes the need for dermatologists in practice or in clinical training to be aware of these associations. Part I of this 2-part continuing medical education article reviews the genetic syndromes with both renal and cutaneous involvement that are most important for the dermatologist to be able to identify, manage, and appropriately refer to nephrology colleagues. Part II reviews the inflammatory syndromes with relevant renal manifestations and therapeutic agents commonly used by dermatologists that have drug-induced effects on or require close consideration of renal function. In addition, we will likewise review therapeutic agents commonly used by nephrologists that have drug-induced effects on the skin that dermatologists are likely to encounter in clinical practice. In both parts of this continuing medical education article, we discuss diagnosis, management, and appropriate referral to our nephrology colleagues in the context of each nephrocutaneous association. There are a significant number of dermatoses associated with renal abnormalities and disease, emphasizing the need for dermatologists to be keenly aware of their presence in order to avoid overlooking important skin conditions with potentially devastating renal complications. This review discusses important nephrocutaneous disease associations with recommendations for the appropriate urgency of referral to nephrology colleagues for diagnosis, surveillance, and early management of potential renal sequelae.",26775773.txt,0
24626649,Adult mastocytosis: a review of the Santo Antonio Hospital 's experience and an evaluation of World Health Organization criteria for the diagnosis of systemic disease.,"BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is a clonal disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormal mast cells in the skin and/or in extracutaneous organs. OBJECTIVES: To present all cases of mastocytosis seen in the Porto Hospital Center and evaluate the performance of World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for systemic disease. METHODS: The cases of twenty-four adult patients with mastocytosis were reviewed. Their clinical and laboratorial characteristics were assessed, and the properties of the criteria used to diagnose systemic mastocytosis were evaluated. RESULTS: The age of disease onset ranged from 2 to 75 years. Twenty-three patients had cutaneous involvement and 75% were referred by dermatologists. Urticaria pigmentosa was the most common manifestation of the disease. One patient with severe systemic mast cell mediator-related symptoms showed the activating V560G KIT mutation. The bone marrow was examined in 79% of patients, and mast cell immunophenotyping was performed in 67% of the participants. Systemic disease was detected in 84% of cases, and 81% of the sample had elevated serum tryptase levels. All the diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis had high specificity and positive predictive value. Bone marrow biopsy had the lowest sensitivity, negative predictive value and efficiency, while the highest such values were observed for mast cell immunophenotyping. Patients were treated with regimens including antihistamines, sodium cromoglycate, alpha-interferon, hydroxyurea and phototherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous involvement is often seen in adult mastocytosis patients, with most individuals presenting with indolent systemic disease. Although serum tryptase levels are a good indicator of mast cell burden, bone marrow biopsy should also be performed in patients with normal serum tryptase, with flow cytometry being the most adequate method to diagnose systemic disease.",24626649.txt,0
23318425,DMAP1 is an essential regulator of ATM activity and function.,"The hereditary autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by mutation in the DNA damage kinase ATM. ATM's main function is to orchestrate DNA repair, thereby maintaining genomic stability. ATM activity is increased in response to several stimuli, including ionising radiation (IR) and hypotonic stress. DNMT1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1) is a member of the TIP60-p400 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complex, which acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16) to affect chromatin relaxation and modulate ATM activation. Here we demonstrate that DMAP1 is required for both modes of ATM activation. Knockdown of DMAP1 impaired IR-induced ATM activation and consequently resulted in radiosensitivity and impaired the G2/M checkpoint. Moreover, DMAP1 was also required for efficient ATM signalling in response to hypotonic stress. Overexpression of DMAP1 increased IR-induced ATM substrate phosphorylation, suggesting that DMAP1 function is rate limiting for ATM signalling. DMAP1 associated with TIP60-dependent HAT activity, and depletion of DMAP1 reduced H4K16 acetylation in response to DNA damage. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors rescued IR-induced ATM signalling in Dmap1-depleted cells. These results suggest that DMAP1 is a critical regulator of ATM activity and function.",23318425.txt,0
