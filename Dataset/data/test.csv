31650704,Comparative aspects of mast cell neoplasia in animals and the role of KIT in prognosis and treatment.,"Mast cell neoplasia clinical presentation and biological behaviour vary considerably across mammalian species, ranging from a solitary benign mass to an aggressive systemic malignancy. Mutations in the KIT Proto-Oncogene Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (KIT) gene are common molecular abnormalities involved in mast cell tumorigenesis. KIT mutations often occur in dog, cat and human neoplastic mast cells and result in altered Kit protein structure and function. In dogs, certain KIT mutations are associated with more malignant and lethal disease. In contrast, KIT mutations in feline and human mast cell neoplasms are not correlated with prognosis, but are of value in diagnosis and treatment planning in humans. KIT genetic abnormalities have not been well investigated in other species, although aberrant cytoplasmic Kit protein staining detected in neoplasms of the ferret, horse and cow resembles aberrant Kit staining patterns detected in neoplastic mast cells of dogs, cats and humans. Mutations within KIT are classified as either regulatory-type or enzymatic pocket-type mutations according to their location within the KIT Proto-Oncogene. Mutations within the enzymatic pocket domain confer tumour resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, knowledge of tumour KIT mutation status adds valuable information for optimizing patient treatment strategies. The use of TKIs in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics has opened a new treatment avenue for patients unresponsive to existing drugs. This review highlights the similarities and differences of mast cell neoplasia in mammals with a special focus on the involvement of KIT in the canine and feline forms in comparison to human mast cell neoplasia.",31650704.txt,1
29525761,Rare case of thoracic endometriosis presenting with lung nodules and pneumothorax.,"We present the case of a 34-year-old Nigerian woman who was referred to the Respiratory team with a 12-month history of breathlessness. She was concurrently being investigated for an abdominal mass and rectal and vaginal bleeding. Consequently, she underwent cross-sectional imaging of her chest, abdomen and pelvis, revealing a small right-sided pneumothorax and right lower lobe pleural-based lesion. Shortly thereafter, she was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and required chest drain insertion. This partially treated her pneumothorax but she required referral to a cardiothoracic centre for definitive diagnosis and to manage her non-resolving pneumothorax. Biopsies from the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery confirmed the very rare diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis.",29525761.txt,0
27935710,Quantification of ATP7B Protein in Dried Blood Spots by Peptide Immuno-SRM as a Potential Screen for Wilson's Disease.,"Wilson's Disease (WD), a copper transport disorder caused by a genetic defect in the ATP7B gene, has been a long time strong candidate for newborn screening (NBS), since early interventions can give better results by preventing irreversible neurological disability or liver cirrhosis. Several previous pilot studies measuring ceruloplasmin (CP) in infants or children showed that this marker alone was insufficient to meet the universal screening for WD. WD results from mutations that cause absent or markedly diminished levels of ATP7B. Therefore, ATP7B could serve as a marker for the screening of WD, if the protein can be detected from dried blood spots (DBS). This study demonstrates that the immuno-SRM platform can quantify ATP7B in DBS in the picomolar range, and that the assay readily distinguishes affected cases from normal controls (p < 0.0001). The assay precision was <10% CV, and the protein was stable for a week in DBS at room temperature. These promising proof-of-concept data open up the possibility of screening WD in newborns and the potential for a multiplexed assay for screening a variety of congenital disorders using proteins as biomarkers in DBS.",27935710.txt,0
24829188,Reducing false-positive incidental findings with ensemble genotyping and logistic regression based variant filtering methods.,"As whole genome sequencing (WGS) uncovers variants associated with rare and common diseases, an immediate challenge is to minimize false-positive findings due to sequencing and variant calling errors. False positives can be reduced by combining results from orthogonal sequencing methods, but costly. Here, we present variant filtering approaches using logistic regression (LR) and ensemble genotyping to minimize false positives without sacrificing sensitivity. We evaluated the methods using paired WGS datasets of an extended family prepared using two sequencing platforms and a validated set of variants in NA12878. Using LR or ensemble genotyping based filtering, false-negative rates were significantly reduced by 1.1- to 17.8-fold at the same levels of false discovery rates (5.4% for heterozygous and 4.5% for homozygous single nucleotide variants (SNVs); 30.0% for heterozygous and 18.7% for homozygous insertions; 25.2% for heterozygous and 16.6% for homozygous deletions) compared to the filtering based on genotype quality scores. Moreover, ensemble genotyping excluded > 98% (105,080 of 107,167) of false positives while retaining > 95% (897 of 937) of true positives in de novo mutation (DNM) discovery in NA12878, and performed better than a consensus method using two sequencing platforms. Our proposed methods were effective in prioritizing phenotype-associated variants, and an ensemble genotyping would be essential to minimize false-positive DNM candidates.",24829188.txt,0
31027701,Improvement in the survival of patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer: Experience in a single institutional 1995-2017.,"OBJECTIVES: In the past two decades several antineoplastic agents have been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the management of these patients has drastically changed. However, there is limited information regarding the impact of these advances on patient survival in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC who received any treatment in the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR) between January 1, 1995 and March 1, 2017. A total of 1,547 consecutive patients were included in this case series. In this analysis, five diagnostic periods were evaluated: 1995-1999 (period A), 2000-2004 (period B), 2005-2009 (period C), 2010-2014 (period D), and 2015-2017 (period E). We compared overall survival (OS) between the periods before and after propensity score matching (PSM) and in patients with EGFR mutation, with ALK fusion gene, or without driver mutation. RESULTS: In the past two decades the OS of patients with stage IV NSCLC improved. The median OSs for periods A, B, C, D, and E were 9.0, 11.0, 13.7, 17.9 months, and not reached, respectively. After PSM with known baseline characteristics, the trend of improvement in OS was similar. However, the OS of patients with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion gene did not improve between periods, despite the availability of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Japan. The OS of patients without a driver mutation was slightly longer in the period E. CONCLUSION: The introduction of new classes of drugs has significantly improved the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC. However, the approval of similar types of drugs may not be associated with further improvement in survival.",31027701.txt,1
36928393,[Genetic testing in epithelial ovarian cancer: implementation of the 'Tumor-First' workflow].,"The new 'Tumor-First' workflow for genetic testing in epithelial ovarian cancer detects women with a genetic predisposition effectively and efficiently. 'Tumor-First' indicates that the tumor DNA of all patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer is examined for the presence of pathogenic variants in, amongst others, BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Women with an aberrant tumor DNA test result are eligible for genetic testing using a sample of blood to detect heredity. Simultaneously, the tumor DNA test provides information on the effectiveness of additional treatment with PARP inhibitors. Thereby, the Tumor-First workflow saves time and healthcare costs. This workflow is currently implemented on a national level. The focus of implementation is transferring knowledge to healthcare professionals on requesting, interpreting and reporting the tumor DNA test and providing adequate support. This nationwide implementation of Tumor-First can improve the recognition of heredity in epithelial ovarian cancer.",36928393.txt,1
31165234,"[Complexity of PEComas : Diagnostic approach, molecular background, clinical management (German version)].","Perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComas) are a family of mesenchymal neoplasms with features of both melanotic and smooth muscle differentiation. PEComa morphology is highly variable and encompasses epithelioid to spindle cells often with clear cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Molecularly, most PEComas are defined by a loss of function of the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Additionally, a distinct small subset of PEComas harboring rearrangements of the TFE3 (Xp11) gene locus has been identified. By presenting a series of three case reports with distinct features, we demonstrate diagnostic pitfalls as well as the importance of molecular work-up of PEComas because of important therapeutic consequences.",31165234.txt,1
31602373,Detection of Novel Fusion Transcript VTI1A-CFAP46 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now the second-highest cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent studies have discovered a wide range of somatic mutations in HCC. These mutations involve various vital signaling pathways such as: Wnt/beta-Catenin, p53, telome-rase reverse transcriptase (TERT), chromatin remodeling, RAS/MAPK signaling, and oxidative stress. However, fusion transcripts have not been broadly explored in HCC. METHODS: To identify novel fusion transcripts in HCC, in the first phase of our study, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (in HCC and paired non-HCC tissues) on 6 patients with a diagnosis of HCC undergoing liver transplantation. RESULTS: As a result of these studies, we discovered the novel fusion transcript, VTI1A-CFAP46. In the second phase of our study, we measured the expression of wild-type VTI1A in 21 HCC specimens, which showed that 10 of 21 exhibited upregulation of wild-type VTI1A in their tumors. VTI1A (Vesicle Transport via Interaction with t-SNARE homolog 1A) is a member of the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) gene family, which is essential for membrane trafficking and function in endocytosis, autophagy, and Golgi transport. Notably, it is known that autophagy is involved in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: The link between novel fusion transcript VTI1A-CFAP46 and autophagy as a potential therapeutic target in HCC patients deserves further investigation. Moreover, this study shows that fusion transcripts are worthy of additional exploration in HCC.",31602373.txt,1
25367873,Early-onset Crohn's disease and autoimmunity associated with a variant in CTLA-4.,"OBJECTIVE: IBD is a group of complex, systemic disorders associated with intestinal inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations. Recent studies revealed Mendelian forms of IBD, which contributed significantly to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and the heritability of IBD. DESIGN: We performed exome sequencing in a family with Crohn's disease (CD) and severe autoimmunity, analysed immune cell phenotype and function in affected and non-affected individuals, and performed in silico and in vitro analyses of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) structure and function. RESULTS: A novel missense variant was identified in CTLA4 encoding CTLA-4, a coinhibitory protein expressed by T cells and required for regulation of T cell activation. The residue affected by the mutation, CTLA-4 Tyr60, is evolutionarily highly conserved, and the identified Y60C variant is predicted to affect protein folding and structural stability and demonstrated to cause impaired CTLA-4 dimerisation and CD80 binding. Intestinal inflammation and autoimmunity in carriers of CTLA-4 Y60C exhibit incomplete penetrance with a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic carrier status to fatal autoimmunity and intestinal inflammation. In a clinically affected CTLA-4 Y60C carrier, T cell proliferation was increased in vitro and associated with an increased ratio of memory to naive T cells in vivo, consistent with impaired regulation of T cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the concept that variants in CTLA4 provide the basis for a novel Mendelian form of early-onset CD associated with systemic autoimmunity. Incomplete penetrance of autoimmunity further indicates the presence of other genetic and/or environmental modifiers.",25367873.txt,0
24498434,Structural and functional characterization of cargo-binding sites on the mu4-subunit of adaptor protein complex 4.,"Adaptor protein (AP) complexes facilitate protein trafficking by playing key roles in the selection of cargo molecules to be sorted in post-Golgi compartments. Four AP complexes (AP-1 to AP-4) contain a medium-sized subunit (mu1-mu4) that recognizes YXXO-sequences (O is a bulky hydrophobic residue), which are sorting signals in transmembrane proteins. A conserved, canonical region in mu subunits mediates recognition of YXXO-signals by means of a critical aspartic acid. Recently we found that a non-canonical YXXO-signal on the cytosolic tail of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) binds to a distinct region of the mu4 subunit of the AP-4 complex. In this study we aimed to determine the functionality of both binding sites of mu4 on the recognition of the non-canonical YXXO-signal of APP. We found that substitutions in either binding site abrogated the interaction with the APP-tail in yeast-two hybrid experiments. Further characterization by isothermal titration calorimetry showed instead loss of binding to the APP signal with only the substitution R283D at the non-canonical site, in contrast to a decrease in binding affinity with the substitution D190A at the canonical site. We solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of the D190A mutant bound to this non-canonical YXXO-signal. This structure showed no significant difference compared to that of wild-type mu4. Both differential scanning fluorimetry and limited proteolysis analyses demonstrated that the D190A substitution rendered mu4 less stable, suggesting an explanation for its lower binding affinity to the APP signal. Finally, in contrast to overexpression of the D190A mutant, and acting in a dominant-negative manner, overexpression of mu4 with either a F255A or a R283D substitution at the non-canonical site halted APP transport at the Golgi apparatus. Together, our analyses support that the functional recognition of the non-canonical YXXO-signal of APP is limited to the non-canonical site of mu4.",24498434.txt,0
31461190,Adenomatous Polyposis Coli as a Major Regulator of Human Embryonic Stem Cells Self-Renewal.,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provide an essential tool to investigate early human development, study disease pathogenesis, and examine therapeutic interventions. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, implicated in the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers and in the autosomal dominant inherited syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Studies into the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in hESCs arrived at conflicting results, due at least in part to variations in culture conditions and the use of external inhibitors and agonists. Here, we directly targeted APC in hESCs carrying a germline APC mutation, derived from affected blastocysts following preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for FAP, in order to answer open questions regarding the role of APC in regulating pluripotency and differentiation potential of hESCs. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9), we generated second hit APC mutations in FAP-hESCs. Despite high CRISPR/Cas9 targeting efficiency and the successful isolation of many clones, none of the isolated clones carried a loss of function mutation in the wild-type (WT) APC allele. Using a fluorescent beta-catenin reporter and analysis of mutated-allele frequencies in the APC locus, we show that APC double mutant hESCs robustly activate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that results in rapid differentiation to endodermal and mesodermal lineages. Here, we provide direct evidence for a strict requirement for constant beta-catenin degradation through the APC destruction complex in order to maintain pluripotency, highlighting a fundamental role for APC in self-renewal of hESCs.

30975761,Inherited predisposition to malignant mesothelioma and overall survival following platinum chemotherapy.,"Survival from malignant mesothelioma, particularly pleural mesothelioma, is very poor. For patients with breast, ovarian, or prostate cancers, overall survival is associated with increased sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy due to loss-of-function mutations in DNA repair genes. The goal of this project was to evaluate, in patients with malignant mesothelioma, the relationship between inherited loss-of-function mutations in DNA repair and other tumor suppressor genes and overall survival following platinum chemotherapy. Patients with histologically confirmed malignant mesothelioma were evaluated for inherited mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Survival was evaluated with respect to genotype and site of mesothelioma. Among 385 patients treated with platinum chemotherapy, median overall survival was significantly longer for patients with loss-of-function mutations in any of the targeted genes compared with patients with no such mutation (P = 0.0006). The effect of genotype was highly significant for patients with pleural mesothelioma (median survival 7.9 y versus 2.4 y, P = 0.0012), but not for patients with peritoneal mesothelioma (median survival 8.2 y versus 5.4 y, P = 0.47). Effect of patient genotype on overall survival, measured at 3 y, remained independently significant after adjusting for gender and age at diagnosis, two other known prognostic factors. Patients with pleural mesothelioma with inherited mutations in DNA repair and other tumor suppressor genes appear to particularly benefit from platinum chemotherapy compared with patients without inherited mutations. These patients may also benefit from other DNA repair targeted therapies such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.",30975761.txt,1
31534167,Non-hematopoietic STAT6 induces epithelial tight junction dysfunction and promotes intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis.,"Enhanced gut permeability due to dysregulated epithelial tight junction is often associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which have a greater risk for developing colorectal cancer. STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic epithelium of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on gut permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial tight junction integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial tight junction dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved gut permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and colitis-associated cancer.",31534167.txt,1
37904051,Mosaic chromosomal alterations in blood across ancestries using whole-genome sequencing.,"Megabase-scale mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) in blood are prognostic markers for a host of human diseases. Here, to gain a better understanding of mCA rates in genetically diverse populations, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 67,390 individuals from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. We observed higher sensitivity with whole-genome sequencing data, compared with array-based data, in uncovering mCAs at low mutant cell fractions and found that individuals of European ancestry have the highest rates of autosomal mCAs and the lowest rates of chromosome X mCAs, compared with individuals of African or Hispanic ancestry. Although further studies in diverse populations will be needed to replicate our findings, we report three loci associated with loss of chromosome X, associations between autosomal mCAs and rare variants in DCPS, ADM17, PPP1R16B and TET2 and ancestry-specific variants in ATM and MPL with mCAs in cis.",37904051.txt,0
30065290,Myelofibrosis Treatment Algorithm 2018.,"Two novel prognostic systems for primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were recently unveiled: GIPSS (genetically inspired prognostic scoring system) and MIPSS70 (mutation-enhanced international prognostic scoring system for transplant-age patients). GIPSS is based exclusively on genetic markers: mutations and karyotype. MIPSS70 includes mutations and clinical risk factors. In its most recent adaptation, the prognostic value of MIPSS70 has been bolstered by the inclusion of a three-tiered cytogenetic risk stratification and use of hemoglobin thresholds that are adjusted for sex and severity (MIPSS70+ version 2.0). GIPSS features four, MIPSS70 three, and MIPSS70+ version 2.0 five risk categories. MIPSS70 is most useful in the absence of cytogenetic information. MIPSS70+ version 2.0 is more comprehensive than MIPSS70 and is the preferred model in the presence of cytogenetic information. Both MIPSS70 and MIPSS70+ version 2.0 require an online score calculator ( http://www.mipss70score.it ). GIPPS offers a lower complexity prognostic tool that reliably identifies candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplant (GIPSS high-risk disease) or long-term observation with little or no therapeutic intervention (GIPSS low-risk disease). Ultimately, we favor a step-wise prognostication approach that starts with GIPSS but also considers MIPSS70+ version 2.0 for confirming the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient.",30065290.txt,0
29288088,"Telangiectasias in Ataxia Telangiectasia: Clinical significance, role of ATM deficiency and potential pathophysiological mechanisms.","Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is named after the two key clinical features that characterize its classical phenotype, namely a progressive cerebellar gait disorder (ataxia) and vascular anomalies (telangiectasias) visible in the conjunctivae and skin. AT is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder, caused by mutations in the ATM gene that encodes the ATM protein. While the ataxia is subject of many publications, the telangiectasias are under emphasised. We here describe the observation that the absence or presence of ATM protein and the level of residual ATM kinase activity are related to the occurrence of telangiectasias and describe the clinical consequences of these vascular malformations. Finally, we hypothesize that ATM dysfunction dysregulates angiogenesis.",29288088.txt,0
31570430,Promoter Methylation Down-regulates B-cell Translocation Gene 1 Expression in Breast Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The mechanism responsible for B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) down-regulation in breast carcinoma remains unknown. We examined the BTG1 expression status in breast carcinoma cells and investigated the mechanism underlying the observed alterations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four breast carcinoma cell lines (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, T-47D, and MCF-7), and one normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) were analyzed. BTG1 expression was examined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot. Methylation status of the BTG1 promoter was analyzed using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). To investigate the effect of methylation on BTG1, the cells were treated with a demethylating agent. RESULTS: The carcinoma cells expressed significantly lower levels of BTG1 mRNA and protein than normal cells. The BTG1 promoter was highly methylated in the carcinoma cells. 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine significantly restored BTG1 expression. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of BTG1 expression through epigenetic repression is involved in mammary carcinogenesis. BTG1 is a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for breast carcinoma.",31570430.txt,1
24819622,Surgical treatment of lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and spondyloptosis in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 and a large lumbar anterior meningocele. Case report and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Lumbar anterior meningocele (MC) is rare in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Although spinal fusion with maximum possible resection of the cele might be indicated in these special cases, reports describing operative procedures are lacking. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a young woman with NF1 and lower back pain due to lumbar anterior MC, extensive osteolysis, and deformation of the lumbar spine. After Harrington spondylodesis from T12 to S1 in 1989, she developed lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and transcutaneous migration of the spondylodesis. Thus the left pole of the spondylodesis was shortened below the level of L5 in 2005. Years later, the patient presented with lower back pain and wound infection. Imaging revealed the MC and avulsion of the right S1 screw with lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and spondyloptosis, and transcutaneous migration of the right spondylodesis pole. Three-stage surgery was indicated with explantation of the Harrington system in the first step and posterior fusion from T10 to S2 in the second step. Finally, vertebral resection, gathering of the cele, and implantation of a customized titanium cage was achieved through an anterior transabdominal approach. Postoperatively, the patient reported sufficient reduction of lower back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar anterior MC is rare in patients with NF1 and may cause spinal instability. When surgery is indicated, long-range spinal fusion and reduction of the cele should be considered. Surgery may be challenging requiring a staged operative procedure and an interdisciplinary collaboration.",24819622.txt,0
30885334,A study of ALK-positive pulmonary squamous-cell carcinoma: From diagnostic methodologies to clinical efficacy.,"BACKGROUND: High concordance has been observed between Ventana D5F3 ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). However, whether a similar conclusion can be applied to lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LSCC) has remained unclear. We therefore evaluated the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) status and the therapeutic effect of an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in IHC- or FISH-positive LSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2403 LSCC patients from three institutions were screened for ALK aberration by IHC. All IHC-positive cases were subjected to FISH (with an approximately equal number of negative cases as a control group) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Clinical efficacy was evaluated for the patients who received TKI therapy. RESULTS: In 2403 cases of LSCC, 37 cases were identified as ALK-positive by IHC. After quality control, 28 cases were succeeded by FISH (six with insufficient tissue, three with lack of signals) and 13 by NGS (24 failed due to insufficient samples or poor DNA quality); the percentage of non-diagnostic tests was 24.3% (9/37) and 64.9% (24/37), respectively. Four cases (4/2394, 0.17%) analyzed by FISH were determined as ALK-positive. For the control group (40 ALK IHC), FISH demonstrated no samples with ALK gene fusion. The concordance between ALK IHC- and ALK FISH-positive results was 14.3% (4/28). In the 13 cases studied by NGS, two cases showed ALK-EML4 fusion (consistent with two FISH-positive results), and two cases were interpreted as harboring an ALK-association gene mutation. Among four patients (two FISH-positive and two IHC-positive only cases) receiving TKI therapy, two patients had stable disease and the other two had progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: The positive concordance rate of ALK IHC and FISH in LSCC is far less than that reported for LADC. Therefore, ALK IHC detection in LSCC cannot be used as a diagnostic method for ALK rearrangement.",30885334.txt,1
30179860,Loss of placental growth factor ameliorates maternal hypertension and preeclampsia in mice.,"Preeclampsia remains a clinical challenge due to its poorly understood pathogenesis. A prevailing notion is that increased placental production of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) causes the maternal syndrome by inhibiting proangiogenic placental growth factor (PlGF) and VEGF. However, the significance of PlGF suppression in preeclampsia is uncertain. To test whether preeclampsia results from the imbalance of angiogenic factors reflected by an abnormal sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, we studied PlGF KO (Pgf-/-) mice and noted that the mice did not develop signs or sequelae of preeclampsia despite a marked elevation in circulating sFLT-1. Notably, PlGF KO mice had morphologically distinct placentas, showing an accumulation of junctional zone glycogen. We next considered the role of placental PlGF in an established model of preeclampsia (pregnant catechol-O-methyltransferase-deficient [COMT-deficient] mice) by generating mice with deletions in both the Pgf and Comt genes. Deletion of placental PlGF in the context of COMT loss resulted in a reduction in maternal blood pressure and increased placental glycogen, indicating that loss of PlGF might be protective against the development of preeclampsia. These results identify a role for PlGF in placental development and support a complex model for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia beyond an angiogenic factor imbalance.",30179860.txt,0
31138587,Tumor-Localized Costimulatory T-Cell Engagement by the 4-1BB/HER2 Bispecific Antibody-Anticalin Fusion PRS-343.,"PURPOSE: 4-1BB (CD137) is a key costimulatory immunoreceptor and promising therapeutic target in cancer. To overcome limitations of current 4-1BB-targeting antibodies, we have developed PRS-343, a 4-1BB/HER2 bispecific molecule. PRS-343 is designed to facilitate T-cell costimulation by tumor-localized, HER2-dependent 4-1BB clustering and activation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PRS-343 was generated by the genetic fusion of 4-1BB-specific Anticalin proteins to a variant of trastuzumab with an engineered IgG4 isotype. Its activity was characterized using a panel of in vitro assays and humanized mouse models. The safety was assessed using ex vivo human cell assays and a toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. RESULTS: PRS-343 targets 4-1BB and HER2 with high affinity and binds both targets simultaneously. 4-1BB-expressing T cells are efficiently costimulated when incubated with PRS-343 in the presence of cancer cells expressing HER2, as evidenced by increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL2, GM-CSF, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma). In a humanized mouse model engrafted with HER2-positive SK-OV-3 tumor cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PRS-343 leads to tumor growth inhibition and a dose-dependent increase of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In IND-enabling studies, PRS-343 was found to be well tolerated, with no overt toxicity and no relevant drug-related toxicologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: PRS-343 facilitates tumor-localized targeting of T cells by bispecific engagement of HER2 and 4-1BB. This approach has the potential to provide a more localized activation of the immune system with higher efficacy and reduced peripheral toxicity compared with current monospecific approaches. The reported data led to initiation of a phase I clinical trial with this first-in-class molecule.See related commentary by Su et al., p. 5732.",31138587.txt,1
30216543,Functional monoamine oxidase B gene intron 13 polymorphism predicts putaminal dopamine turnover in de novo Parkinson's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of common functional polymorphisms in genes involved in dopamine metabolism on striatal dopamine turnover in de novo Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: This was an observer-blinded cohort study investigating effects of common functional polymorphisms in dopa decarboxylase (DDC, rs921451), monoamine oxidase B (MAOB; rs1799836), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT, rs4680), and dopamine transporter/solute carrier family 6 member 3 (DAT/SLC6A3, variable number tandem repeats) genes on 18 F-fluorodopa uptake and an effective distribution volume ratio (inverse of dopamine turnover) measured by 18 F-fluorodopa PET in 28 untreated PD patients. RESULTS: Patients carrying the MAOBCC/(C)/CT genotype (low/intermediate enzyme activity) had a lower dopamine turnover in the putamen (higher mean effective distribution volume ratio) when compared with patients with MAOBTT/(T) genotype (high enzyme activity). Striatal PET measures were not different between variants in the remaining genes. CONCLUSIONS: The MAOB (rs1799836) polymorphism predicts putaminal dopamine turnover in early PD with the MAOBTT allele linked to high enzyme activity leading to higher intrinsic dopamine turnover, which has been demonstrated to constitute a risk factor for motor complications.   2018 The Authors.

31212602,Bioinformatics Analysis for Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Cancer.,"Molecular analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that circulates in plasma and other body fluids represents a ""liquid biopsy"" approach for non-invasive cancer screening or monitoring. The rapid development of sequencing technologies has made cfDNA a promising source to study cancer development and progression. Specific genetic and epigenetic alterations have been found in plasma, serum, and urine cfDNA and could potentially be used as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in various cancer types. In this review, we will discuss the molecular characteristics of cancer cfDNA and major bioinformatics approaches involved in the analysis of cfDNA sequencing data for detecting genetic mutation, copy number alteration, methylation change, and nucleosome positioning variation. We highlight specific challenges in sensitivity to detect genetic aberrations and robustness of statistical analysis. Finally, we provide perspectives regarding the standard and continuing development of bioinformatics analysis to move this promising screening tool into clinical practice.",31212602.txt,1
30558068,Familial intracranial arachnoid cysts with a missense mutation (c.2576C > T) in RERE: A case report.,"RATIONALE: Arachnoid cysts are relatively common intracranial space-occupying lesions; nevertheless, familial intracranial arachnoid cysts are extremely rare, with only a few cases having been reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: The proband was a 7-year-old girl who had experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures 5 times in the 8 days prior to admission. Nine months later, her 6-year-old younger female cousin presented to us with a 3-day history of headache. DIAGNOSES: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the diagnosis of arachnoid cyst for both of the girls. INTERVENTIONS: A cyst-peritoneal shunting and cyst fenestration were performed for the 7-year-old girl and her cousin separately. Sanger sequencing revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (c.2576C > T) in the Arginine-Glutamic Acid Dipeptide Repeats gene (RERE). OUTCOMES: The outcome was favorable and the follow-up was uneventful. LESSONS: We hypothesize that the mutation in RERE may be associated with the pathogenesis of familial intracranial arachnoid cysts.",30558068.txt,0
31546041,EURACAN/IASLC Proposals for Updating the Histologic Classification of Pleural Mesothelioma: Towards a More Multidisciplinary Approach.,"INTRODUCTION: Molecular and immunologic breakthroughs are transforming the management of thoracic cancer, although advances have not been as marked for malignant pleural mesothelioma where pathologic diagnosis has been essentially limited to three histologic subtypes. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group (pathologists, molecular biologists, surgeons, radiologists, and oncologists), sponsored by European Network for Rare Adult Solid Cancers/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, met in 2018 to critically review the current classification. RESULTS: Recommendations include: (1) classification should be updated to include architectural patterns and stromal and cytologic features that refine prognostication; (2) subject to data accrual, malignant mesothelioma in situ could be an additional category; (3) grading of epithelioid malignant pleural mesotheliomas should be routinely undertaken; (4) favorable/unfavorable histologic characteristics should be routinely reported; (5) clinically relevant molecular data (programmed death ligand 1, BRCA 1 associated protein 1 [BAP1], and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) should be incorporated into reports, if undertaken; (6) other molecular data should be accrued as part of future trials; (7) resection specimens (i.e., extended pleurectomy/decortication and extrapleural pneumonectomy) should be pathologically staged with smaller specimens being clinically staged; (8) ideally, at least three separate areas should be sampled from the pleural cavity, including areas of interest identified on pre-surgical imaging; (9) image-acquisition protocols/imaging terminology should be standardized to aid research/refine clinical staging; (10) multidisciplinary tumor boards should include pathologists to ensure appropriate treatment options are considered; (11) all histologic subtypes should be considered potential candidates for chemotherapy; (12) patients with sarcomatoid or biphasic mesothelioma should not be excluded from first-line clinical trials unless there is a compelling reason; (13) tumor subtyping should be further assessed in relation to duration of response to immunotherapy; and (14) systematic screening of all patients for germline mutations is not recommended, in the absence of a family history suspicious for BAP1 syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: These multidisciplinary recommendations for pathology classification and application will allow more informative pathologic reporting and potential risk stratification, to support clinical practice, research investigation and clinical trials.",31546041.txt,1
31372940,Clinical Implications of Chromosomal Instability (CIN) and Kinetochore Abnormalities in Breast Cancers.,"Genetic instability is a defining property of cancer cells and is the basis of various lesions including point mutations, copy number alterations and translocations. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is part of the genetic instability of cancer and consists of copy number alterations in whole or parts of cancer cell chromosomes. CIN is observed in differing degrees in most cancers. In breast cancer, CIN is commonly part of the genomic landscape of the disease and has a higher incidence in aggressive sub-types. Tumor suppressors that are commonly mutated or disabled in cancer, such as p53 and pRB, play roles in protection against CIN, and as a result, their dysfunction contributes to the establishment or tolerance of CIN. Several structural and regulatory proteins of the centromeres and kinetochore, the complex structure that is responsible for the correct distribution of genetic material in the daughter cells during mitosis, are direct or, mostly, indirect transcription targets of p53 and pRB. Thus, despite the absence of structural defects in genes encoding for centromere and kinetochore components, dysfunction of these tumor suppressors may have profound implications for the correct function of the mitotic apparatus contributing to CIN. CIN and its prognostic and therapeutic implications in breast cancer are discussed in this article.",31372940.txt,1
31681608,Epigenetic Targets in Synovial Sarcoma: A Mini-Review.,"Synovial Sarcomas (SS) are a type of Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) and represent 8-10% of all STS cases. Although SS can arise at any age, it typically affects younger individuals aged 15-35 and is therefore part of both pediatric and adult clinical practices. SS occurs primarily in the limbs, often near joints, but can present anywhere. It is characterized by the recurrent pathognomonic chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) that most frequently fuses SSX1 or SSX2 genes with SS18. This leads to the expression of the SS18-SSX fusion protein, which causes disturbances in several interacting multiprotein complexes such as the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex, also known as the BAF complex and the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). Furthermore, this promotes widespread epigenetic rewiring, leading to aberrant gene expression that drives the pathogenesis of SS. Good prognoses are characterized predominantly by small tumor size and young patient age. Whereas, high tumor grade and an increased genomic complexity of the tumor constitute poor prognostic factors. The current therapeutic strategy relies on chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the latter of which can lead to chronic side effects for pediatric patients. We will focus on the known roles of SWI/SNF, PRC1, and PRC2 as the main effectors of the SS18-SSX-mediated genome modifications and we present existing biological rationale for potential therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.",31681608.txt,1
31412611,Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) for Detecting Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Rearrangement in Lung Cancer: Clinically Relevant Technical Aspects.,"In 2011, the Vysis Break Apart ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a companion diagnostic for detecting ALK rearrangement in lung cancer patients who may benefit from treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. This assay is the current ""gold standard"". According to updated ALK testing guidelines from the College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the Association for Molecular Pathology published in 2018, ALK immunohistochemistry is formally an alternative to ALK FISH, and simultaneous detection of multiple hot spots, including, at least, ALK, ROS1, RET, MET, ERBB2, BRAF and KRAS genes is also recommended while performing next generation sequencing (NGS)-based testing. Therefore, ALK status in a specimen can be tested by different methods and platforms, even in the same institution or laboratory. In this review, we discuss several clinically relevant technical aspects of ALK FISH, including pros and cons of the unique two-step (50- to 100-cell) analysis approach employed in the Vysis Break Apart ALK FISH assay, including: the preset cutoff value of >=15% for a positive result; technical aspects and biology of discordant results obtained by different methods; and incidental findings, such as ALK copy number gain or amplification and co-existent driver mutations. These issues have practical implications for ALK testing in the clinical laboratory following the updated guidelines.",31412611.txt,1
25081057,Selective suppression of excessive GluN2C expression rescues early epilepsy in a tuberous sclerosis murine model.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by dominant mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor genes is characterized by the presence of brain malformations, the cortical tubers that are thought to contribute to the generation of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Here we report that tuberless heterozygote Tsc1(+/-) mice show functional upregulation of cortical GluN2C-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in an mTOR-dependent manner and exhibit recurrent, unprovoked seizures during early postnatal life (<P19). Seizures are generated intracortically in the granular layer of the neocortex. Slow kinetics of aberrant GluN2C-mediated currents in spiny stellate cells promotes excessive temporal integration of persistent NMDAR-mediated recurrent excitation and seizure generation. Accordingly, specific GluN2C/D antagonists block seizures in Tsc1(+/-) mice in vivo and in vitro. Likewise, GluN2C expression is upregulated in TSC human surgical resections, and a GluN2C/D antagonist reduces paroxysmal hyperexcitability. Thus, GluN2C receptor constitutes a promising molecular target to treat epilepsy in TSC patients.",25081057.txt,0
30971355,Prevalence and prognostic value of c-kit and TP53 mutations in canine mast cell tumours.,"Cutaneous mast cell tumours (MCT) are among the most frequent malignancies in dogs. Their clinical behaviour is highly variable and, with the exception of mutations in the c-kit gene, little is known about their genetic aetiology. The mutational status of the c-kit exons 8, 9 and 11, and exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene was analysed to find markers for molecular stratification of MCTs and predictors of clinical outcome. Mutations in the c-kit gene were detected in 19.5% (n = 8/41) samples and their presence was significantly associated with the high histopathological grade (P = 0.038). Mutations in the DNA binding domain of the TP53 gene were found in 14.6% (n = 6/41) of the analysed MCTs, and their frequency was similar in low and high grade MCTs (P > 0.05). TP53 mutations were not useful prognostic factors in this sample of canine cutaneous MCTs.",30971355.txt,1
27711228,"DNA/MVA Vaccination of HIV-1 Infected Participants with Viral Suppression on Antiretroviral Therapy, followed by Treatment Interruption: Elicitation of Immune Responses without Control of Re-Emergent Virus.","GV-TH-01, a Phase 1 open-label trial of a DNA prime:Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boost vaccine (GOVX-B11), was undertaken in HIV infected participants on antiretroviral treatment (ART) to evaluate safety and vaccine-elicited T cell responses, and explore the ability of elicited CD8+ T cells to control viral rebound during analytical treatment interruption (TI). Nine men who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of seroconversion and had sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months were enrolled. Median age was 38 years, median pre-ART HIV-1 RNA was 140,000 copies/ml and mean baseline CD4 count was 755/mul. Two DNA, followed by 2 MVA, inoculations were given 8 weeks apart. Eight subjects completed all vaccinations and TI. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were generally mild, with no serious or grade 4 events. Only reactogenicity events were considered related to study drug. No treatment emergent viral resistance was seen. The vaccinations did not reduce viral reservoirs and virus re-emerged in all participants during TI, with a median time to re-emergence of 4 weeks. Eight of 9 participants had CD8+ T cells that could be stimulated by vaccine-matched Gag peptides prior to vaccination. Vaccinations boosted these responses as well as eliciting previously undetected CD8+ responses. Elicited T cells did not display signs of exhaustion. During TI, temporal patterns of viral re-emergence and Gag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion suggested that vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells had been stimulated by re-emergent virus in only 2 of 8 participants. In these 2, transient decreases in viremia were associated with Gag selection in known CD8+ T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that escape mutations, already archived in the viral reservoir, plus a poor ability of CD8+ T cells to traffic to and control virus at sites of re-emergence, limited the therapeutic efficacy of the DNA/MVA vaccine.

31160360,Elucidating a false-negative MYC break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization probe study by next-generation sequencing in a patient with high-grade B-cell lymphoma with IGH/MYC and IGH/BCL2 rearrangements.,"The identification of MYC rearrangements in several mature B-cell neoplasms is critical for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Commercially available fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe sets, including IGH/MYC dual-color dual-fusion (D-FISH) and MYC break-apart probes (BAPs), serve as the primary methodology utilized to detect MYC rearrangements. However, performing either IGH/MYC D-FISH or MYC BAP FISH studies in isolation has been reported to result in false-negative results because of the complex nature of 8q24 rearrangements involving the MYC gene region. We report a 60-yr-old male with newly diagnosed high-grade B-cell lymphoma with a negative MYC BAP study, but with positive BCL2 and BCL6 BAP studies. Per our current laboratory algorithm to concurrently interrogate the MYC gene region with both MYC BAP and IGH/MYC D-FISH probe sets, we performed IGH/MYC D-FISH studies and detected an IGH/MYC fusion. To further characterize the discrepant MYC results obtained by FISH, a next-generation sequencing strategy, mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), was performed and revealed a small insertion (~200 kb) of the IGH locus downstream from the MYC gene that was undetectable by MYC BAP studies. This case highlights the importance of utilizing both IGH/MYC D-FISH and MYC BAP sets to detect potential cryptic MYC rearrangements and also demonstrates the power of MPseq to characterize complex structural rearrangements and copy-number abnormalities unappreciable by FISH.",31160360.txt,1
31086113,A Comparison of DNA Mutation and Copy Number Profiles of Primary Breast Cancers and Paired Brain Metastases for Identifying Clinically Relevant Genetic Alterations in Brain Metastases.,"Improving the systemic treatment of brain metastases (BM) in primary breast cancer (PBC) is impaired by the lack of genomic characterization of BM. To estimate the concordance of DNA copy-number-alterations (CNAs), mutations, and actionable genetic alterations (AGAs) between paired samples, we performed whole-genome array-comparative-genomic-hybridization, and targeted-next-generation-sequencing on 14 clinical PBC-BM pairs. We found more CNAs, more mutations, and higher tumor mutational burden, and more AGAs in BM than in PBC; 92% of the pairs harbored at least one AGA in the BM not observed in the paired PBC. This concerned various therapeutic classes, including tyrosine-kinase-receptor-inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/ mammalian Target of Rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/MTOR)-inhibitors, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-inhibitors, or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-inhibitors. With regards to the PARP-inhibitors, the homologous recombination defect score was positive in 79% of BM, compared to 43% of PBC, discordant in 7 out of 14 pairs, and positive in the BM in 5 out of 14 cases. CDK-inhibitors were associated with the largest percentage of discordant AGA appearing in the BM. When considering the AGA with the highest clinical-evidence level, for each sample, 50% of the pairs harbored an AGA in the BM not detected or not retained from the analysis of the paired PBC. Thus, the profiling of BM provided a more reliable opportunity, than that of PBC, for diagnostic decision-making based on genomic analysis. Patients with BM deserve an investigation of several targeted therapies.",31086113.txt,1
36930084,An integrative pan-cancer analysis illustrating the key role of LRP11 in cervical cancer.,"Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 11 (LRP11) was involved in the progression of several tumors. However, its role in cervical cancer still remains uncertain.
The original tumor data was downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas and genotype-tissue expression databases. The expression of LRP11 in normal tissues, tumor tissues and adjacent tissues were evaluated. In addition, we also explored the genetic alteration, prognostic value, and gene function of LRP11. We deeply assessed the interaction between LRP11 and tumor immunity at the pan-cancer level. Finally, research on the association between LRP11 and the resistance of anti-tumor drugs was carried out.
LRP11 was highly expressed and played a risk prognostic factor in cervical cancer and a variety of tumors. Enrichment analysis revealed that LRP11 was involved in multiple tumor malignant pathways. Our research also pointed out the unique role between LRP11 and tumor immune microenvironment. The tumor immune microenvironment of patients with high expression of LRP11 are lack of most immune cells, indicating a immune desert tumor microenvironment. The final drug resistant analysis suggested that patients with high expression of LRP11 may be related to the resistance of many anti-tumor drugs.
LRP11 was a potential oncogene and prognostic marker in cervical cancer and pan-cancer. Patients with high LRP11 expression may have immune desert tumor microenvironment.",36930084.txt,1
30989185,Isolated Bone Marrow Non-Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Preceding RUNX1-Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Case Report and Literature Review.,"OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of concomitant myeloid neoplasms was recently reported to be unexpectedly high among adults without non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (non-LCH); however, the coexistence of non-LCH with RUNX1 genetic aberration has not been reported previously. METHODS: Herein, we report a 23-year-old woman with severe pancytopenia diagnosed with non-LCH following presentation with pancytopenia and marrow examination showing histiocytosis positive for CD45, CD68, CD136, and lysozyme but negative for CD1a, langerin, and S100. RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing showed RUNX1 mutation and NF1 mutation. In the ensuing 6 months, she developed hepatosplenomegaly, and repeat bone marrow evaluation was diagnostic of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Repeat mutational analysis showed again presence of RUNX1 mutation. She underwent induction therapy but died of septic shock. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of RUNX1 mutation in both non-LCH and AML bone marrow specimens at differing time points is suggestive of a biologic association of both distinct disease entities.",30989185.txt,1
38558419,Prenatal detection of mosaicism for a genome wide uniparental disomy cell line in a cohort of patients: Implications and outcomes.,"To investigate the prenatal detection rate of mosaicism by SNP microarray analysis, in which an individual has not one, but two, complete genomes (sets of DNA) in their body, a normal biparental line with a Genome Wide Uniparental Disomy (GWUPD) cell line was used.
This study retrospectively examines the prenatal detection of GWUPD in a cohort of ∼90,000 prenatal specimens and ∼20,000 products of conceptions (POCs) that were studied by SNP microarray.
In total, 25 cases of GWUPD were detected; 16 cases were detected prenatally with GWUPD (∼0.018%) and 9 POCs revealed GWUPD (0.045%). The nine POC specimens presented with placental abnormalities. The 12 amniotic fluid specimens were ascertained because of abnormal ultrasound findings. Nine of 12 pregnancies had findings consistent with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or because of abnormal placentas. However, three pregnancies were detected with GWUPD of maternal origin, with less common findings and demonstrated maternal origin. Four other pregnancies showed GWUPD in a chorionic villus sample, but normal findings in amniotic fluid and apparently normal fetal development.
This cohort with GWUPD mosaicism expands our understanding of GWUPD and has implications for prenatal care and counseling. Additional studies are necessary to understand the rarer maternal GWUPD.",38558419.txt,0
37740653,Hippocampal and neocortical BRAF mutant non-expansive lesions in focal epilepsies.,"Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy-associated Hippocampal Sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is a syndrome associated with various aetiologies. We previously identified CD34-positive extravascular stellate cells (CD34+ cells) possibly related to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncogenic variant in a subset of MTLE-HS. We aimed to identify the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncogenic variants and characterise the CD34+ cells.
We analysed BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncogenic variant by digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction in 53 MTLE-HS samples (25 with CD34+ cells) and nine non-expansive neocortical lesions resected during epilepsy surgery (five with CD34+ cells). Ex vivo multi-electrode array recording, immunolabelling, methylation microarray and single nuclei RNAseq were performed on BRAF<sup>wildtype</sup> MTLE-HS and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant non-expansive lesion of hippocampus and/or neocortex.
We identified a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncogenic variant in five MTLE-HS samples with CD34+ cells (19%) and in five neocortical samples with CD34+ cells (100%). Single nuclei RNAseq of resected samples revealed two unique clusters of abnormal cells (including CD34+ cells) associated with senescence and oligodendrocyte development in both hippocampal and neocortical BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant samples. The co-expression of the oncogene-induced senescence marker p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and the outer subventricular zone radial glia progenitor marker HOPX in CD34+ cells was confirmed by multiplex immunostaining. Pseudotime analysis showed that abnormal cells share a common lineage from progenitors to myelinating oligodendrocytes. Epilepsy surgery led to seizure freedom in eight of the 10 patients with BRAF mutant lesions.
BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> underlies a subset of MTLE-HS and epileptogenic non-expansive neocortical focal lesions. Detection of the oncogenic variant may help diagnosis and open perspectives for targeted therapies.",37740653.txt,0
26020630,Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoT Induces Atypical Anoikis Apoptosis in Target Host Cells by Transforming Crk Adaptor Protein into a Cytotoxin.,"Previously, we demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoT induces potent apoptosis in host epithelial cells in a manner that primarily depends on its ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (ADPRT) activity. However, the mechanism underlying ExoT/ADPRT-induced apoptosis remains undetermined. We now report that ExoT/ADPRT disrupts focal adhesion sites, activates p38beta and JNK, and interferes with integrin-mediated survival signaling; causing atypical anoikis. We show that ExoT/ADPRT-induced anoikis is mediated by the Crk adaptor protein. We found that Crk-/- knockout cells are significantly more resistant to ExoT-induced apoptosis, while Crk-/- cells complemented with Crk are rendered sensitive to ExoT-induced apoptosis. Moreover, a dominant negative (DN) mutant form of Crk phenocopies ExoT-induced apoptosis both kinetically and mechanistically. Crk is generally believed to be a component of focal adhesion (FA) and its role in cellular survival remains controversial in that it has been found to be either pro-survival or pro-apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that although Crk is recruited to FA sites, its function is likely not required for FA assembly or for survival per se. However, when modified by ExoT or by mutagenesis, it can be transformed into a cytotoxin that induces anoikis by disrupting FA sites and interfering with integrin survival signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first example whereby a bacterial toxin exerts its cytotoxicity by subverting the function of an innocuous host cellular protein and turning it against the host cell.",26020630.txt,0
29249553,Liver Angiomyolipomas in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-Their Incidence and Course.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology and clinical significance of hepatic angiomyolipomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data from 187 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. The prevalence, progression, and potential relationship between liver lesions and other clinical findings, including genetic associations, were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 187 patients (14.9%) had hepatic lesions. There was a predominance of female over male patients in individuals with liver lesions (17 versus 11), with statistical significance in patients under five years of age (P < 0.05). All individuals having hepatic lesions who also had available genetic testing data (n = 20) were diagnosed with a TSC2 gene mutation. All patients with liver lesions had coexisting renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) (P < 0.05). The age of onset of renal lesions was lower and their prevalence was significantly higher in patients with liver involvement (P < 0.05). In most instances, hepatic lesions measured several millimeters in diameter and were clinically asymptomatic. Progressive lesion growth was documented in six individuals but with no clinical consequences to date. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the association of hepatic lesions with TSC2 mutations, a common origin of liver and renal AMLs, as well as the predominance of female patients in this group. Hepatic AMLs are relatively common but mostly benign lesions.",29249553.txt,0
31239192,Moxifloxacin resistance and genotyping of Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare isolates in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: Although fluoroquinolones are considered as alternative therapies of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, the association between fluoroquinolone resistance and MAC genotypes in clinical isolates from individuals not previously treated for MAC infection is not fully clear. METHODS: Totals of 154 M. avium isolates and 35 Mycobacterium intracellulare isolates were obtained from treatment-naive patients with pulmonary MAC disease at the diagnosis of MAC infection at 8 hospitals in Japan. Their susceptibilities of moxifloxacin were determined by broth microdilution methods. Moxifloxacin-resistant isolates were examined for mutations of gyrA and gyrB. Variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) assay was performed using 15 M. avium VNTR loci and 16 M. intracellulare VNTR loci. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin susceptibility was categorized as resistant and intermediate for 6.5% and 16.9%, respectively, of M. avium isolates and 8.6% and 17.1% of M. intracellulare isolates. Although the isolates of both species had amino acid substitutions of Thr 96 and Thr 522 at the sites corresponding to Ser 95 in the M. tuberculosis GyrA and Gly 520 in the M. tuberculosis GyrB, respectively, these substitutions were observed irrespective of susceptibility and did not confer resistance. The VNTR assays showed revealed three clusters among M. avium isolates and two clusters among M. intracellulare isolates. No significant differences in moxifloxacin resistance were observed among these clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Although resistance or intermediate resistance to moxifloxacin was observed in approximately one-fourth of M. avium and M. intracellulare isolates, this resistance was not associated with mutations in gyrA and gyrB or with VNTR genotypes.",31239192.txt,0
29728436,Splenic cyst and its management in a 21-month-old boy: a rare complication of invasive meningococcal disease.,"Splenic complications of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are well recognised, though cyst formation is rare, particularly in paediatric populations. The best approach to their management is not yet established. This case outlines the management of a splenic cyst in a 21-month-old boy following severe IMD. The case took place in the context of an acute emergence of serogroup W prompting significant media attention and subsequent change in vaccination practice at a jurisdictional level in Australia. The patient was critically unwell early in the illness, then later a collection in the left upper quadrant was detected, shown on ultrasound to be a 11.6x7.7 cm splenic cyst. In this case, the cyst was managed by ultrasound-guided drainage tube insertion. The residual collection was small and stable on subsequent imaging.",29728436.txt,0
30908670,Somatic alterations detected in diagnostic prostate biopsies provide an inadequate representation of multifocal prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The majority of clinical prostate cancers are multifocal with morphological and molecular heterogeneity. Adequate tissue representation is crucial for the clinical utility of multigene panel sequencing of core needle biopsies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genomic heterogeneity in multifocal prostate cancer and to analyze how representative preoperative biopsies are of spatially separated tumor foci. METHODS: We analyzed at least 2 tumor foci and 1 to 3 preoperative biopsy cores from 11 patients. Diagnostic biopsies, as well as fresh frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, from major tumor foci of radical prostatectomy specimens were macrodissected for the enrichment of tumor tissue. DNA was extracted and sequenced. We analyzed structural alterations, mutations, and copy number variations and compared the genomic profiles of tumor foci with those of preoperative biopsies. RESULTS: Alterations were rarely shared between foci, indicating a high degree of genomic heterogeneity. In 8 of 11 men at least 1 tumor focus was represented by the biopsies defined as harboring at least 1 common clonal somatic event. In only one case, somatic alterations from two spatially separate tumors were identified in the biopsies. Of the mutations and structural variants detected in fresh frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy material, only an average of 19% (range 0-44) and 55% (range 0-100), respectively, were found in preoperative biopsies where a common somatic origin was established. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocal prostate cancer is a somatically heterogeneous disease in which systematic needle biopsies do not provide sufficient molecular representation of the somatic alterations detected in spatially distinct tumor areas. Targeted biopsies, directed at separate tumor foci, could potentially improve tissue representation of these heterogeneous foci in preoperative biopsies.",30908670.txt,1
31292799,Double heterozygous mutation in the BRCA1 and ATM genes involved in development of primary metachronous tumours: a case report.,"PURPOSE: Between 5 and 10% of cases of breast cancer (BC) are attributable to a genetic susceptibility. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes described in the late 1990s are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, and the clinical management of carriers of pathogenic variants in these genes is defined in several clinical guidelines (Paluch-Shimon et al. in Ann Oncol 27(suppl 5):v103-v110, 2016; Llort et al. in Clin Transl Oncol 17(12):956-961, 2015). However, the pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 represent only a third of the causes of hereditary BC (Easton et al. in N Engl J Med 372:2243-2257, 2015). The incorporation of NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) techniques in the genetic diagnosis of this pathology, in addition to minimising the cost and time of analysis, allows the simultaneous study of other genes of high and moderate penetrance (Easton et al. in N Engl J Med 372:2243-2257, 2015; Op. Cit.; Tung et al. in Cancer 121(1):25-33, 2015). To date, there are not many cases or series of patients that describe the co-occurrence of two pathogenic variants in these genes of BC. Cases of double heterozygosis have been described with the presence of pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, BLM or NBN (Nomizu et al. in Breast Cancer 22(5):557-61, 2015; Heidemann et al. in Breast Cancer Res Treat 134(3):1229-1239, 2012; Zuradelli et al. in Breast Cancer Res Treat 124(1):251-258, 2010; Sokolenko et al. in Breast Cancer Res Treat 145(2):553-562, 2014). METHODS: We report the case of a patient diagnosed with multiple tumours who presented two pathogenic variants in heterozygosis. RESULTS: Two pathogenic variants, c.5123C > A (p.Ala1708Glu) in the BRCA1 gene and c.2413C > T (p.Arg805X) in the ATM gene were detected in heterozygosis. Said variants were confirmed by Sanger-type sequencing using specific primers. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of gene panels using NGS in the study of hereditary cancer involves the detection of heterozygous double mutations in genes of high and moderate penetrance for cancer, although with a low frequency.",31292799.txt,1
29855039,Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia: clinical and molecular review.,"Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (HED) is a genetic human disorder which affects structures of ectodermal origin. Although there are autosomal recessive and dominant forms, X-linked (XL) is the most frequent form of the disease. This XL-HED phenotype is associated with mutations in the gene encoding the transmembrane protein ectodysplasin-1 (EDA1), a member of the TNFalpha-related signaling pathway. The proteins from this pathway are involved in signal transduction from ectoderm to mesenchyme leading to the development of ectoderm-derived structures in the fetus such as hair, teeth, skin, nails, and eccrine sweat glands. The aim of this review was to update the main clinical characteristics of HED regarding to recent molecular advances in the comprehension of all the possible genes involved in this group of disorders since it is known that Eda-A1-Edar signaling has multiple roles in ectodermal organ development, regulating their initiation, morphogenesis, and differentiation steps. The knowledge of the biological mechanisms that generate HED is needed for both a better detection of possible cases and for the design of efficient prevention and treatment approaches.",29855039.txt,0
27830539,Primary autoimmune myelofibrosis: a case report and review of the literature.,"Autoimmune myelofibrosis is a rare, distinct clinicopathological entity that can occur in isolation (primary) or in association with systemic autoimmune disorders (secondary), such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome. This disease is characterized by isolated or combined chronic cytopenias associated with autoimmune phenomena and bone-marrow fibrosis. Due to the rarity of this disease, patients are frequently misdiagnosed as having primary myelofibrosis, the most common form of bone-marrow fibrosis. Distinguishing between both disease entities is essential given the drastic therapeutic and prognostic differences between both disorders. We report a case of primary autoimmune myelofibrosis presenting with severe isolated anemia refractory to multiple lines of therapy. This patient was initially misdiagnosed as primary myelofibrosis. The absence of the characteristic features of primary myelofibrosis and the lack of a clonal abnormality on cytogenetic and molecular studies, particularly JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation analyses, confirmed the absence of an aberrant neoplastic process. Furthermore, the presence of monoclonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangements delineated the presence of an autoimmune disorder supporting our diagnosis of primary autoimmune myelofibrosis.",27830539.txt,0
31148183,A Noncoding Regulatory RNAs Network Driven by Circ-CDYL Acts Specifically in the Early Stages Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest-rising causes of cancer-related death worldwide, but its deficiency of specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the early stages lead to severe inadequacy in the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Covalently closed circular RNA (circRNA), which was once considered an aberrant splicing by-product, is now drawing new interest in cancer research because of its remarkable functionality. Beneath the surface of the dominant functional proteins events, a hidden circRNA-centric noncoding regulatory RNAs network active in the very early stage of HCC is here revealed by a genome-wide analysis of mRNA, circRNA, and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles. Circ-CDYL (chromodomain Y like) is specifically up-regulated in the early stages of HCC and therefore contributes to the properties of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM)-positive liver tumor-initiating cells. Circ-CDYL interacts with mRNAs encoding hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor asparagine hydroxylase (HIF1AN) by acting as the sponge of miR-892a and miR-328-3p, respectively. Subsequently, activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT serine/threonine kinase-mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1/beta-catenin and NOTCH2 pathways, which promote the expression of the effect proteins, baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5 or SURVIVIN) and MYC proto-oncogene, is influenced by circ-CDYL. A treatment incorporating circ-CDYL interference and traditional enzyme inhibitors targeting PI3K and HIF1AN demonstrated highly effective inhibition of stem-like characteristics and tumor growth in HCC. Finally, we demonstrated that circ-CDYL expression or which combined with HDGF and HIF1AN are both independent markers for discrimination of early stages of HCC with the odds ratios of 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.17) and 124.58 (95% CI, 13.26-1170.56), respectively. Conclusion: These findings uncover a circRNA-centric noncoding regulatory RNAs network in the early stages of HCC and thus provide a possibility for surveillance and early treatment of HCC.",31148183.txt,1
37569542,Detection of Primary DNA Lesions by Transient Changes in Mating Behavior in Yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Using the Alpha-Test.,"Spontaneous or induced DNA lesions can result in stable gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations due to their inaccurate repair, ultimately resulting in phenotype changes. Some DNA lesions per se may interfere with transcription, leading to temporary phenocopies of mutations. The direct impact of primary DNA lesions on phenotype before their removal by repair is not well understood. To address this question, we used the alpha-test, which allows for detecting various genetic events leading to temporary or hereditary changes in mating type α→a in heterothallic strains of yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Here, we compared yeast strains carrying mutations in DNA repair genes, mismatch repair (<i>pms1</i>), base excision repair (<i>ogg1</i>), and homologous recombination repair (<i>rad52</i>), as well as mutagens causing specific DNA lesions (UV light and camptothecin). We found that double-strand breaks and UV-induced lesions have a stronger effect on the phenotype than mismatches and 8-oxoguanine. Moreover, the loss of the entire chromosome III leads to an immediate mating type switch α→a and does not prevent hybridization. We also evaluated the ability of primary DNA lesions to persist through the cell cycle by assessing the frequency of UV-induced inherited and non-inherited genetic changes in asynchronous cultures of a wild-type (<i>wt</i>) strain and in a <i>cdc28-4</i> mutant arrested in the G1 phase. Our findings suggest that the phenotypic manifestation of primary DNA lesions depends on their type and the stage of the cell cycle in which it occurred.",37569542.txt,0
31199507,Temporal and spatial effects and survival outcomes associated with concordance between tissue and blood KRAS alterations in the pan-cancer setting.,"We investigated the impact of time interval, primary vs. metastatic biopsy site, variant allele fraction (VAF) and histology on concordance of KRAS alterations in tissue vs. circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and association of concordance with survival. Blood and tissue were evaluated by next-generation sequencing in 433 patients with diverse cancers. Altogether, 101 patients (23.3%) had KRAS alterations: 56, ctDNA (12.9%); 81, tissue (18.7%); and 36, both (8.3%). The overall blood and tissue concordance rate for KRAS alterations was 85%, but was mainly driven by the large negative/negative subset. Therefore, specificity of one test for the other was high (88.1-94.3%), while sensitivity was not high (44.4-64.3%) and was lower still in patients with >6 vs. <=2 months between blood and tissue sampling (31.0-40.9% vs. 51.2-84.0%; p = 0.14 time interval-dependent sensitivity of blood for tissue; p = 0.003, tissue for blood). Positive concordance rate for KRAS alterations was 57.1% vs. 27.4% (colorectal vs. noncolorectal cancer; p = 0.01), but site of biopsy (primary vs. metastatic) and VAF (%ctDNA) was not impactful. The presence of KRAS alterations in both tests was independently associated with shorter survival from diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.86) and from recurrent/metastatic disease (1.70; 1.03-2.81). Positive concordance of KRAS alterations between ctDNA and tissue was negatively affected by a longer time period between blood and tissue sampling and was higher in colorectal cancer than in other malignancies. The presence of KRAS alterations in both tests was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival.",31199507.txt,1
30883505,Circulating Cell-Free DNA-Diagnostic and Prognostic Applications in Personalized Cancer Therapy.,"Genomic analyses in oncologic care allow for the development of more precise clinical laboratory tests that will be critical for personalized pharmacotherapy. Traditional biopsy-based approaches are limited by the availability of sequential tissue specimens to detect resistance. Blood-based genomic profiling (""liquid biopsy"") is useful for longitudinal monitoring of tumor genomes and can complement biopsies. Tumor-associated mutations can be identified in cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patient blood samples and used for monitoring disease activity. The US Food and Drug Administration approved a liquid biopsy test for EGFR-activating mutations in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer as a companion diagnostic for therapy selection. ctDNA also allows for the identification of mutations selected by treatment such as EGFR T790M in non-small-cell lung cancer. ctDNA can also detect mutations such as KRAS G12V in colorectal cancer and BRAF V600E/V600K in melanoma. Chromosomal aberration pattern analysis by low-coverage whole genome sequencing is a new, broader approach. Genomic imbalances detected in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can be used to compute a copy number instability (CNI) score. In clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the change in CNI score can serve as an early predictor of therapeutic response to chemotherapy/immunotherapy of many cancer types. In multivariable models, it could be shown that the CNI score was superior to clinical parameters for prediction of overall survival in patients with head and neck cancer. There is emerging evidence for the clinical validity of ctDNA testing regarding identification of candidates for targeted therapies, prediction of therapeutic response, early detection of recurrence, resistance mutation detection, measuring genetic heterogeneity, tumor burden monitoring, and risk stratification. Improvement of sensitivity to detect tumors at very early stages is difficult due to insufficient mutant DNA fraction of <=0.01%. Further developments will include validation in prospective multicenter interventional outcome studies and the development of digital platforms to integrate diagnostic data.",30883505.txt,1

31177124,Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R and L55M Polymorphisms as Potential Predisposition Factors for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: PON1 gene has an executive role in antioxidant defense, protecting cells from genotoxic factors. Q192R and L55M PON1 polymorphisms reduce catalytic activity of the encoded protein. These polymorphisms were studied in 300 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and 106 healthy donors. They were also associated with patients' cytogenetic findings, to investigate their possible implication in CLL pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SNP genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Karyotypic analysis was also performed by chromosome G-banding analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Genotypic and allelic distribution of Q192R polymorphism showed a statistically significant higher frequency of mutant genotypes and mutant alleles in patients compared to controls. The same observation was noted in patients with abnormal karyotypes and those carrying abn14q32 and del(6q). A statistically increased frequency for the mutant allele was also revealed in patients with del(11q). On the contrary, L55M polymorphism showed a similar distribution between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Q192R polymorphism plays a role in CLL predisposition and the formation of specific chromosomal aberrations.",31177124.txt,1
29781571,New approach to accurate interpretation of sickle cell disease newborn screening by applying multiple of median cutoffs and ratios.,"BACKGROUND: The main goal of newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease (SCD) is to detect affected neonates so that specific preventive care can be implemented. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) used for NBS has high sensitivity and specificity, but we lack guidelines for quantitative hemoglobin (Hb) fraction interpretation. The purpose of this study was to determine cutoff values to standardize quantitative interpretation in SCD NBS for different clinical situation such as, red blood cell transfusion or beta-thalassemia, which can be real screening pitfalls. METHODS: Retrospective study of 75,026 samples from the neonatal screening program analyzed in our laboratory. Precise HbA and HbS percentages at birth were recorded and median values established for each gestational age, allowing percentage results to be expressed in normal gestation-specific multiples of the median (MoM). Three threshold values of clinical interest were determined. RESULTS: High levels of HbA (>2.5 MoM) allowed identification of newborns who received transfusions. Low levels of HbS (<=0.7 MoM) allowed detection of the association between HbS and other mutations of the beta-globin gene (i.e., HbHope, beta0-thalassemia, etc.). An HbA/HbS ratio <0.5 to distinguish healthy carriers from SCD with S/beta+-thalassemia. The screening accuracy for each threshold was established. The screening accuracy of low-level HbA, which is determinant in identifying the subgroup of patients at risk of beta-thalassemia, will be determined prospectively. CONCLUSIONS: This new approach introduces tools for a quantitative interpretation in SCD NBS by HPLC methods and could allow standardization of interpretation between centers.",29781571.txt,0
35608106,Targeting <i>FGFR3</i> alterations with adjuvant infigratinib in invasive urothelial carcinoma: the phase III PROOF 302 trial.,"PROOF 302 is an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adjuvant phase III trial (NCT04197986) in approximately 218 patients from 120 centers worldwide.

25911850,Analysis of oxidative stress status through MN test and serum MDA levels in PCOS women.,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial reproductive healthcare problem affecting 4-12% of women and a leading cause of female infertility worldwide. The potential genetic contributors of PCOS are unclear. However, over the past decade emerging evidence has shown that increased Oxidative Stress (OS) and decreased antioxidant status were often linked with PCOS. The present case-control study was aimed to assess the reactive oxygen species induced OS in women from South India. A total of 164 individuals comprising of 89 patients and 75 controls were enrolled in the present study. For all the subjects, the frequency of micronucleated cells (MNC) in epithelial samples and serum Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were estimated to assess genomic instability and cytotoxicity respectively. A statistically significant difference between the groups were identified with respect to Body Mass Index, Waist to Hip Ratio, luteinizing hormone and prolactin levels (< 0.05), however the mean follicle stimulating hormone was not different between the groups (p = 0.055). The frequency of MN cells (5.89 +- 4.86 vs. 2.24 +- 2.01) and mean serum MDA (360.84 +- 87.08 vs. 301.70 +- 82.82) levels were considerably higher in patients than controls (p = < 0.0001), furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between MNC and MDA levels in patients (r = 0.349, p = 0.0008) and not in controls (r = 0.104, p = 0.37), suggest high OS in PCOS women. Therefore, MN assay and serum MDA levels may serve together or individually as biomarkers of OS in PCOS women.",25911850.txt,0
27558955,Molecular hydrogen suppresses activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.,"Molecular hydrogen (H2) is effective for many diseases. However, molecular bases of H2 have not been fully elucidated. Cumulative evidence indicates that H2 acts as a gaseous signal modulator. We found that H2 suppresses activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by promoting phosphorylation and degradation omicronf beta-catenin. Either complete inhibition of GSK3 or mutations at CK1- and GSK3-phosphorylation sites of beta-catenin abolished the suppressive effect of H2. H2 did not increase GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, indicating that H2 has no direct effect on GSK3 itself. Knock-down of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or Axin1, which form the beta-catenin degradation complex, minimized the suppressive effect of H2 on beta-catenin accumulation. Accordingly, the effect of H2 requires CK1/GSK3-phosphorylation sites of beta-catenin, as well as the beta-catenin degradation complex comprised of CK1, GSK3, APC, and Axin1. We additionally found that H2 reduces the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Oral intake of H2 water tended to ameliorate cartilage degradation in a surgery-induced rat osteoarthritis model through attenuating beta-catenin accumulation. We first demonstrate that H2 suppresses abnormally activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which accounts for the protective roles of H2 in a fraction of diseases.",27558955.txt,0
26546030,"Update on Mastocytosis (Part 1): Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, and Diagnosis.","Mastocytosis is a term used to describe a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by clonal proliferation of mast cells in various organs. The organ most often affected is the skin. Mastocytosis is a relatively rare disorder that affects both sexes equally. It can occur at any age, although it tends to appear in the first decade of life, or later, between the second and fifth decades. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of mastocytosis has improved greatly in recent years, with the discovery that somatic c-kit mutations and aberrant immunophenotypic features have an important role. The clinical manifestations of mastocytosis are diverse, and skin lesions are the key to diagnosis in most patients.",26546030.txt,0
35927017,"Clinicopathological characteristics, genetics and prognosis of patients with myeloid sarcoma: a single-center study.","Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a rare tumour comprising myeloid blasts occurring at an anatomical site other than the bone marrow. We sought to investigate both paediatric and adult patients with MS diagnosed at our institution and determine possible correlations among their clinicopathological, phenotypic, molecular and prognostic features.
This study retrospectively evaluated the data of 45 patients diagnosed with MS at Ege University Faculty of Medicine Hospital, Turkey, over a 17-year period.
The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1, and the median age was 39.12 years. The most commonly involved sites were the skin, lymph nodes, soft tissues and bone. Immunohistochemically, CD68-KP1 was the most commonly expressed marker, followed by CD33, myeloperoxidase, CD117, lysozyme, CD68-PGM1 and CD34. Of the patients, 26 (57.7%) presented with de novo MS, 7 (15.5%) had simultaneous acute myeloid leukaemia and 12 (26.8%) had a previous history of haematological disorders. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 46.4% and 39.8%, respectively; the median OS duration was 11 months. Increasing age had a negative prognostic relationship with survival (p = 0.04). Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in approximately 6/10 (60%) of paediatric patients and 6/9 (66.7%) of adult patients. t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation was identified in 20% of paediatric patients.
MS diagnosis is usually challenging; an expanded immunohistochemical panel should be used for an accurate diagnosis. Although MS generally has a poor prognosis, increasing age appears to be associated with a worse outcome.",35927017.txt,1
26095439,Urinary 11beta-PGF2alpha and N-methyl histamine correlate with bone marrow biopsy findings in mast cell disorders.,"BACKGROUND: The utility of measuring histamine and prostaglandin metabolites in the urine of patients with mastocytosis has not been critically examined in a large series of patients. This study examined the relationship between the extent of increase in urinary excretion of 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha and N-methyl histamine, with serum tryptase, whole blood serotonin, and bone marrow findings including morphology, percentage involvement, and abnormal mast cell phenotype. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 90 patients who were continuously enrolled in the study for a period of 6 years (2008-2014). We recorded serum tryptase, whole blood serotonin, levels of urinary mast cell metabolites 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha and N-methyl histamine (NMH), and bone marrow findings. RESULTS: Urinary mast cell metabolites 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha and N-methyl histamine correlated with levels of serum tryptase, mast cell burden in the bone marrow, the presence of mast cell aggregates, and atypical mast cells on bone marrow biopsy. Whole blood serotonin did not have a significant correlation with the serum tryptase or mast cell burden in the bone marrow. Urinary NMH was significantly different between c-kit D816V-positive and c-kit D816V-negative patients, while 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha was not. Urinary 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha 24-h excretion >3500 ng and NMH levels >400 mug/gm Cr corresponded with the high degree of bone marrow biopsies positive for atypical mast cells, the presence of aggregates, and c-kit mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Easily obtained and quantified urinary metabolites of histamine (greater than twice the upper limit of normal) and prostaglandin D2 (>3.4 times the upper limit of normal) correlate well with bone marrow findings of mastocytosis.",26095439.txt,0
38463005,Impaired polyamine metabolism causes behavioral and neuroanatomical defects in a mouse model of Snyder-Robinson syndrome.,"Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the SMS gene, which encodes spermine synthase, and aberrant polyamine metabolism. SRS is characterized by intellectual disability, thin habitus, seizure, low muscle tone/hypotonia and osteoporosis. Progress towards understanding and treating SRS requires a model that recapitulates human gene variants and disease presentations. Here, we evaluated molecular and neurological presentations in the G56S mouse model, which carries a missense mutation in the Sms gene. The lack of SMS protein in the G56S mice resulted in increased spermidine/spermine ratio, failure to thrive, short stature and reduced bone density. They showed impaired learning capacity, increased anxiety, reduced mobility and heightened fear responses, accompanied by reduced total and regional brain volumes. Furthermore, impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was evident in G56S cerebral cortex, G56S fibroblasts and Sms-null hippocampal cells, indicating that SMS may serve as a future therapeutic target. Collectively, our study establishes the suitability of the G56S mice as a preclinical model for SRS and provides a set of molecular and functional outcome measures that can be used to evaluate therapeutic interventions for SRS.",38463005.txt,0
31002364,"JAK3/STAT3 oncogenic pathway and PRDM1 expression stratify clinicopathologic features of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type.","The inactivation of tumor suppressor gene positive regulatory domain containing I (PRDM1) and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) have been detected in the majority of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (EN-NK/T-NT) cases. In the present study, their association with and effects on the clinicopathologic features of EN-NK/T-NT are described. PRDM1 was revealed to be expressed in 19 out of 58 patients (32.8%) with EN-NK/T-NT, and phosphorylated STAT3 was overexpressed in 42 out of 58 (72.4%). Oncogenic pathways were investigated by NanoString encounter technology in 5 PRDM1(+) and 5 PRDM1(-) EN-NK/T-NT specimens. Multiple oncogenic pathways involved in cell apoptosis, cellcycle (CC) and angiogenesis were discriminately activated in EN-NK/T-NT cases, and in PRDM1(+) cases in particular. The sustained activation of the Janus kinase 3 (JAK)/STAT3 pathway was more pronounced. In addition, missense mutations in the SRC homology 2 domain of STAT3 were detected in 7 out of 37 EN-NK/T-NT cases (18.92%), and the acquired mutation was related to the activation of the JAK3/STAT3 pathway. The downregulation of PRDM1 and upregulation of phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) were associated with angiocentric infiltration of EN-NK/T-NT (P=0.039). Notably, the prognosis of patients in the PRDM1(+)/STAT3 [mutated (mut-)] group was considerably improved than that of patients in the STAT3(mut+)/PRDM(-) group (P=0.037). In addition, the inhibition of NK/T cell lymphoma cell lines by Stattic and tofacitinib could suppress cell proliferation by inducing cell apoptosis or arresting the CC. The present results revealed that the JAK3/STAT3 oncogenic pathway and PRDM1 expression could stratify clinicopathologic features of EN-NK/T-NT. The inhibition of the JAK3/STAT3 pathway may serve as a treatment option for EN-NK/T-NT.",31002364.txt,1
36930754,Nanoengineered Gallium Ion Incorporated Formulation for Safe and Efficient Reversal of PARP Inhibition and Platinum Resistance in Ovarian Cancer.,"Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the main systemic treatment of ovarian cancer (OC). However, the inevitable development of platinum and poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) resistance is associated with poor outcomes, which becomes a major obstacle in the management of this disease. The present study developed ""all-in-one"" nanoparticles that contained the PARPi olaparib and gallium (Ga) (III) (olaparib-Ga) to effectively reverse PARPi resistance in platinum-resistant A2780-cis and SKOV3-cis OC cells and in SKOV3-cis tumor models. Notably, the olaparib-Ga suppressed SKOV3-cis tumor growth with negligible toxicity. Moreover, the suppression effect was more evident when combining olaparib-Ga with cisplatin or carboplatin, as evaluated in A2780-cis and SKOV3-cis cells. Mechanistically, the combined treatment induced DNA damage, which elicited the activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/AMT- and Rad3-related (ATR) checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1)/Chk2 signal transduction pathways. This led to the arrest of cell cycle progression at S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phases, which eventually resulted in apoptosis and cell death due to unrepairable DNA damage. In addition, effective therapeutic responses to olaparib-Ga and cisplatin combination or olaparib-Ga and carboplatin combination were observed in SKOV3-cis tumor-bearing animal models. Altogether, the present findings demonstrate that olaparib-Ga has therapeutic implications in platinum-resistant OC cells, and the combination of olaparib-Ga with cisplatin or carboplatin may be promising for treating patients with OC who exhibit resistance to both PARPi and platinum.",36930754.txt,1
31597840,The differential diagnosis of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN): the updated WHO criteria.,"The classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are characterized by clonal myeloproliferation without features of myelodysplasia. The diagnostic approach proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) uses clinical features, peripheral blood counts and smear analysis, bone marrow (BM) morphology, karyotype and molecular genetic tests to classify MPN subtypes. The detection of characteristic driver mutations like JAK2V617F, JAK2 exon 12, MPL, and calrecticulin (CALR) is a major diagnostic feature. JAK2 mutations are detected in more than 90% of patients with PV and are therefore used as highly sensitive clonal marker in this subtype. However, JAK2 mutations may also occur in ET and PMF, while CALR is virtually not seen in PV. Therefore, BM remains the central diagnostic platform and is essential for distinguishing ET from pre-fibrotic PMF and diagnosing cases which do not express JAK2, MPL or CALR ('wild-type' or 'triple-negative' MPN). The standardization of relevant BM features is mandatory to recognize characteristic and easy to assess patterns that enable an accurate discrimination between the MPN subtypes. Key parameters include cellularity, erythropoiesis and neutrophil granulopoiesis in context with specific features of megakaryocytes as well as the BM fiber content, especially in early stage MPN that present with thrombocytosis and clinically mimic essential thrombocythemia.",31597840.txt,1
31483231,Overview of Current Immunotherapies Targeting Mutated KRAS Cancers.,"The occurrence of somatic substitution mutations of the KRAS proto-oncogene is highly prevalent in certain cancer types, which often leads to constant activation of proliferative pathways and subsequent neoplastic transformation. It is often seen as a gateway mutation in carcinogenesis and has been commonly deemed as a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis and relapse when conventional chemotherapeutics are employed. Additionally, its mutational status also renders EGFR targeted therapies ineffective owing to its downstream location. Efforts to discover new approaches targeting this menacing culprit have been ongoing for years without much success, and with incidences of KRAS positive cancer patients being on the rise, researchers are now turning towards immunotherapies as the way forward. In this scoping review, recent immunotherapeutic developments and advances in both preclinical and clinical studies targeting K-ras directly or indirectly via its downstream signal transduction machinery will be discussed. Additionally, some of the challenges and limitations of various K-ras targeting immunotherapeutic approaches such as vaccines, adoptive T cell therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors against KRAS positive cancers will be deliberated.",31483231.txt,1
27855285,Computational drug treatment simulations on projections of dysregulated protein networks derived from the myelodysplastic mutanome match clinical response in patients.,"Although the majority of MDS patients fail to achieve clinical improvement to approved therapies, some patients benefit from treatment. Predicting patient response prior to therapy would improve treatment effectiveness, avoid treatment-related adverse events and reduce healthcare costs. Three separate cohorts of MDS patients were used to simulate drug response to lenalidomide alone, hypomethylating agent (HMA) alone, or HMA plus lenalidomide. Utilizing a computational biology program, genomic abnormalities in each patient were used to create an intracellular pathway map that was then used to screen for drug response. In the lenalidomide treated cohort, computer modeling correctly matched clinical responses in 37/46 patients (80%). In the second cohort, 15 HMA patients were modeled and correctly matched to responses in 12 (80%). In the third cohort, computer modeling correctly matched responses in 10/10 patients (100%). This computational biology network approach identified GGH overexpression as a potential resistance factor to HMA treatment and paradoxical activation of beta-catenin (through Csnk1a1 inhibition) as a resistance factor to lenalidomide treatment. We demonstrate that a computational technology is able to map the complexity of the MDS mutanome to simulate and predict drug response. This tool can improve understanding of MDS biology and mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance.",27855285.txt,0
28504684,Fully automated 5-plex fluorescent immunohistochemistry with tyramide signal amplification and same species antibodies.,"The ability to simultaneously visualize the presence, abundance, location and functional state of many targets in cells and tissues has been described as a true next-generation approach in immunohistochemistry (IHC). A typical requirement for multiplex IHC (mIHC) is the use of different animal species for each primary (1 Ab) and secondary (2 Ab) antibody pair. Although 1 Abs from different species have been used with differently labeled species-specific 2 Abs, quite often the appropriate combination of antibodies is not available. More recently, sequential detection of multiple antigens using 1 Abs from the same species used a microwaving treatment between successive antigen detection cycles to elute previously bound 1 Ab/2 Ab complex and therefore to prevent the cross-reactivity of anti-species 2 Abs used in subsequent detection cycles. We present here a fully automated 1 Ab/2 Ab complex heat deactivation (HD) method on Ventana's BenchMark ULTRA slide stainer. This method is applied to detection using fluorophore-conjugated tyramide deposited on the tissue and takes advantage of the strong covalent bonding of the detection substrate to the tissue, preventing its elution in the HD process. The HD process was characterized for (1) effectiveness in preventing Ab cross-reactivity, (2) impact on the epitopes and (3) impact on the fluorophores. An automated 5-plex fluorescent IHC assay was further developed using the HD method and rabbit 1 Abs for CD3, CD8, CD20, CD68 and FoxP3 immune biomarkers in human tissue specimens. The fluorophores were carefully chosen and the narrow-band filters were designed to allow visualization of the staining under fluorescent microscope with minimal bleed through. The automated 5-plex fluorescent IHC assay achieved staining results comparable to the respective single-plex chromogenic IHC assays. This technology enables automated mIHC using unmodified 1 Abs from same species and the corresponding anti-species 2 Ab on a clinically established automated platform to ensure staining quality, reliability and reproducibility.",28504684.txt,0
38505014,More attention should be paid to Omicron-associated sepsis: a multicenter retrospective study in south China.,"The Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly transmissible but causes less severe disease compared to other variants. However, its association with sepsis incidence and outcomes is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of Omicron-associated sepsis, as per the Sepsis 3.0 definition, in hospitalized patients, and to explore its relationship with clinical characteristics and prognosis.
This multicenter retrospective study included adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection across six tertiary hospitals in Guangzhou, China from November 2022 to January 2023. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and its components were calculated at hospital admission to identify sepsis. Outcomes assessed were need for intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curves evaluated the predictive value of sepsis versus other biomarkers for outcomes.
A total of 299 patients (mean age: 70.1±14.4 years, 42.14% female) with SOFA score were enrolled. Among them, 152 were categorized as non-serious cases while the others were assigned as the serious group. The proportion of male patients, unvaccinated patients, patients with comorbidity such as diabetes, chronic cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease was significantly higher in the serious than non-serious group. The median SOFA score of all enrolled patients was 1 (interquartile range, 0-18). In our study, 147 patients (64.19%) were identified as having sepsis upon hospital admission, with the majority of these septic patients (113, representing 76.87%) being in the serious group, the respiratory, coagulation, cardiovascular, central nervous, and renal organ SOFA scores were all significantly higher in the serious compared to the non-serious group. Among septic patients, 20 out of 49 (40.81%) had septic shock as indicated by lactate measurement within 24 hours of admission, and the majority of septic patients were in the serious group (17/20, 76.87%). Sepsis was present in 118 out of 269 (43.9%) patients in the general ward, and among those with sepsis, 34 out of 118 (28.8%) later required ICU care during hospitalization. By contrast, none of the patients without sepsis required ICU care. Moreover, the mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with than without sepsis.
A considerable proportion of patients infected with Omicron present with sepsis upon hospital admission, which is associated with a poorer prognosis. Therefore, early recognition of viral sepsis by evaluation of the SOFA score in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients is crucial.",38505014.txt,0
31169702,Intrahepatic adrenocortical adenoma arising from adrenohepatic fusion mimicking hepatic malignancy: Two case reports.,"RATIONALE: Intrahepatic adrenocortical adenoma (IAA) arising from adrenohepatic fusion (AHF) is rare and its imaging findings are not well established. Moreover, it is easily misdiagnosed as malignant hepatic tumor in patients at risk of malignancy. Its key finding is the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland. When IAA from AHF is suspected, biopsy should be considered to avoid unnecessary surgery. Herein, we report 2 cases of IAA from AHF. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old woman was admitted due to a 1.5-cm hypoechoic nodule in the right hepatic lobe detected on ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance due to chronic hepatitis B. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to evaluate the hepatic mass. Another 75-year-old woman was admitted due to rectal adenocarcinoma detected on colonoscopy. Contrast-enhanced CT depicted a 2.5-cm mass in the right hepatic lobe. DIAGNOSIS: In case 1, CT and MRI showed a 1.5-cm subcapsular mass in the right hepatic lobe with typical findings of HCC in a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The mass was confirmed as IAA from AHF after the laparoscopic surgery. In case 2, CT showed advanced rectal malignancy and a 2.5-cm poorly enhancing mass in the right hepatic lobe. The tentative diagnosis was hepatic metastasis. However, based on the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland during preoperative review, the presumed diagnosis was changed to IAA from AHF, which was confirmed on biopsy. INTERVENTIONS: The hepatic mass connected with the right adrenal gland was laparoscopically resected in case 1. Laparoscopic lower anterior resection for rectal malignancy and percutaneous biopsy for the hepatic mass were performed in case 2. OUTCOMES: The first patient had an uneventful recovery, without recurrence on the 3-year follow-up CT. The second patient had an uneventful postoperative course and has been alive for 12 months postoperatively without pathologically proven IAA changes on follow-up CT. LESSONS: When hepatic mass is found adjacent to the right adrenal gland on imaging, the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland should be investigated. When IAA arising from AHF is suspected, biopsy should be considered to avoid unnecessary surgery.",31169702.txt,1
30888062,"Two novel variants in the ATM gene causing ataxia-telangiectasia, including a duplication of 90 kb: Utility of targeted next-generation sequencing in detection of copy number variation.","Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, ocular apraxia, immunodeficiency, telangiectasia, elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration, radiosensitivity and cancer predisposition. Classical A-T is caused by biallelic variants on ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene, leading to a loss of function of the protein kinase ATM, involved in DNA damage repair. Atypical presentations can be found in A-T-like disease or in Nijmegen breakage syndrome, caused by deficiency of mre11 or nibrin proteins, respectively. In this report, we present the genetic characterization of a 4-year-old female with clinical diagnosis of A-T. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed two novel heterozygous mutations in the ATM gene: a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) at exon 47 (NM_000051.3:c.6899G > C; p.Trp2300Ser) and ~90 kb genomic duplication spanning exons 17-61, NG_009830.1:g.(41245_49339)_(137044_147250)dup. These findings were validated by Sanger sequencing and MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) analysis respectively. Familial segregation study confirmed that the two variants are inherited, and the infant is a compound heterozygote. Thus, our study expands the spectrum of ATM pathogenic variants and demonstrates the utility of targeted NGS in the detection of copy number variation.",30888062.txt,1
24690944,"Massively parallel sequencing of patients with intellectual disability, congenital anomalies and/or autism spectrum disorders with a targeted gene panel.","Developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (DD/ID) affects 1-3% of all children. At least half of these are thought to have a genetic etiology. Recent studies have shown that massively parallel sequencing (MPS) using a targeted gene panel is particularly suited for diagnostic testing for genetically heterogeneous conditions. We report on our experiences with using massively parallel sequencing of a targeted gene panel of 355 genes for investigating the genetic etiology of eight patients with a wide range of phenotypes including DD/ID, congenital anomalies and/or autism spectrum disorder. Targeted sequence enrichment was performed using the Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment Kit and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 using paired-end reads. For all eight patients, 81-84% of the targeted regions achieved read depths of at least 20x, with average read depths overlapping targets ranging from 322x to 798x. Causative variants were successfully identified in two of the eight patients: a nonsense mutation in the ATRX gene and a canonical splice site mutation in the L1CAM gene. In a third patient, a canonical splice site variant in the USP9X gene could likely explain all or some of her clinical phenotypes. These results confirm the value of targeted MPS for investigating DD/ID in children for diagnostic purposes. However, targeted gene MPS was less likely to provide a genetic diagnosis for children whose phenotype includes autism.",24690944.txt,0
29021147,Atypical haematological presentation in a case of polycythaemia vera with a new variant mutation detected in exon 12: c.1605G>T (p.Met535Ile).,"One of the major genetic insights into the pathogenesis of polycythaemia vera included the identification of the somatic point gain-of-function mutations in Janus kinase 2 gene-first JAK2V617F on exon 14, present in 95%-97% of the cases, and later on exon 12. In the literature, we can find some reported studies where different exon 12 mutations are identified. Unlike patients with JAK2V617F mutation in exon 14, the mutation at exon 12 is not usually associated with an increase in the three haematopoietic series (erythrocytosis, leucocytosis and thrombocytosis). It appears to be associated with a distinct syndrome, mostly characterised by isolated and more marked erythrocytosis, independently of the mutational variant. We report here the case of a patient who is JAK2exon 12 positive, presenting a novel mutation-c.1605G>T (p.Met535Ile)-associated with c.1612C>T (p.His538Tyr) mutation previously described, evidencing an atypical clinical phenotype.",29021147.txt,0
26545049,Microdeletion del(22)(q12.1) excluding the MN1 gene in a patient with craniofacial anomalies.,"Several studies have recently reported that 22q12.1 deletions encompassing the MN1 gene are associated with craniofacial anomalies. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that MN1 haploinsufficiency may be solely responsible for craniofacial anomalies and/or cleft palate. We report here the case of a 4-year-old boy presenting with global developmental delay and craniofacial anomalies including severe maxillary protrusion and retromicrognathia. Array-CGH detected a 2.4 Mb de novo deletion of chromosome 22q12.1 which did not encompass the MN1 gene thought to be the main pathological candidate in 22q12.1 deletions. This observation, combined with data from other patients from the Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensemble Resources (DECIPHER), suggests that other gene(s) in the 22q12.1 region are likely involved in craniofacial anomalies and/or may contribute to the phenotypic variability observed in patients with MN1 deletion.",26545049.txt,0
26456532,Diagnosis and classification of mastocytosis in non-specialized versus reference centres: a Spanish Network on Mastocytosis (REMA) study on 122 patients.,"The diagnosis of 'rare diseases', such as mastocytosis, remains a challenge. Despite this, the precise benefits of referral of mastocytosis patients to highly specialized reference centres are poorly defined and whether patients should be managed at non-specialized versus reference centres remains a matter of debate. To evaluate the quality and efficiency of diagnostic procedures performed at the reference centres for mastocytosis in Spain (REMA) versus other non-reference centres, we retrospectively analysed a series of 122 patients, for the overall degree of agreement obtained for the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic and classification criteria betwen the referring and REMA centres. Our results showed that not all WHO diagnostic criteria were frequently investigated at the referring centres. Among the five WHO diagnostic criteria, the highest degree of agreement was obtained for serum tryptase levels [median 90% (95% confidence interval 84-96%)]; in turn, the overall agreement was significantly lower for the major histopathological criterion [80% (72-89%)], and the other three minor criteria: cytomorphology [68% (56-80%)] immunophenotyping of BM mast cells [75% (62-87%)] and detection of the KIT mutation [34% (8-60%)].

31026246,Impact of initial stage on metastatic melanoma survival.,"Patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma have varied clinical courses, even in patients with similar disease characteristics. We examine the impact of initial stage of melanoma diagnosis, BRAF status of primary melanoma, and receiving adjuvant therapy on postmetastatic overall survival (pmOS). We studied melanoma patients presenting to Perlmutter Cancer Center at New York University and prospectively enrolled in New York University melanoma biospecimen database and followed up on protocol-driven schedule. Patients were stratified by stage at initial melanoma diagnosis as per AJCC 7th ed. guidelines. pmOS was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards models were used to assess hazard ratios (HRs). Three hundred and four out of 3204 patients developed metastatic disease over the time of follow-up (median follow-up 2.2 years, range: 0.08-35.2 years). Patients diagnosed with stage I (n=96) melanoma had longer pmOS (29.5 months) than those diagnosed with stage II (n=99, pmOS 14.9 months) or stage III (n=109, pmOS 15.1 months) melanoma (P=0.036). Initial stage of diagnosis remained significant in multivariate analysis when controlling for lactate dehydrogenase and site of metastases [primary diagnosis stage II (HR 1.44, P=0.046), stage III (HR 1.5, P=0.019)]. Adjuvant treatment was associated with better survival but BRAF mutation status did not show an association. Our data challenge the general assumption that primary melanomas converge upon diagnosis of metastatic disease and behave uniformly. Primary stage of melanoma at the time of diagnosis may be prognostic of outcome, similar to lactate dehydrogenase and metastatic disease sites.",31026246.txt,1

The patient with EGFR R222C mutation had a more severe course, earlier diagnosis, subsequent leptomeningeal metastatic disease, required more aggressive therapies, and died 9 years after diagnosis. Patients with KRAS mutations and SRGAP3-RAF-1 fusion had a more indolent course. Our series expands the molecular phenotype of tectal glioma with the potential for leptomeningeal dissemination.

31400126,[The value of detecting MLL gene rearrangement in children with acute monocytic leukemia].,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of detecting the rearrangement of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene in children with acute mononuclear leukemia (AML). METHODS: Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe was used to detect MLL gene rearrangement in 68 children with AML by interphase FISH. The results were compared with that of conventional G banding chromosomal analysis. RESULTS: Among the 68 children, 28 were detected by FISH with positive hybridization signals, with a detection rate for MLL gene rearrangement being 41.2%. Twelve (17.6%) reciprocal translocations and interruption of 11q23 were detected by G banding analysis. The difference in the detection rates between the two methods was statistically significant (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of FISH assay for MLL gene rearrangement was significantly higher than that of G banding chromosomal karyotyping. Combined use of both methods for children with AML can improve the detection rate of MLL gene rearrangements and provide crucial clues for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.",31400126.txt,1
31076661,Going to extremes: determinants of extraordinary response and survival in patients with cancer.,"Research into factors affecting treatment response or survival in patients with cancer frequently involves cohorts that span the most common range of clinical outcomes, as such patients are most readily available for study. However, attention has turned to highly unusual patients who have exceptionally favourable or atypically poor responses to treatment and/or overall survival, with the expectation that patients at the extremes may provide insights that could ultimately improve the outcome of individuals with more typical disease trajectories. While clinicians can often recount surprising patients whose clinical journey was very unusual, given known clinical characteristics and prognostic indicators, there is a lack of consensus among researchers on how best to define exceptional patients, and little has been proposed for the optimal design of studies to identify factors that dictate unusual outcome. In this Opinion article, we review different approaches to identifying exceptional patients with cancer and possible study designs to investigate extraordinary clinical outcomes. We discuss pitfalls with finding these rare patients, including challenges associated with accrual of patients across different treatment centres and time periods. We describe recent molecular and immunological factors that have been identified as contributing to unusual patient outcome and make recommendations for future studies on these intriguing patients.",31076661.txt,1
28654064,Detection and Visualization of DNA Damage-induced Protein Complexes in Suspension Cell Cultures Using the Proximity Ligation Assay.,"The DNA damage response orchestrates the repair of DNA lesions that occur spontaneously, are caused by genotoxic stress, or appear in the context of programmed DNA breaks in lymphocytes. The Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated kinase (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-Related kinase (ATR) and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent Protein Kinase (DNA-PKcs) are among the first that are activated upon induction of DNA damage, and are central regulators of a network that controls DNA repair, apoptosis and cell survival. As part of a tumor-suppressive pathway, ATM and ATR activate p53 through phosphorylation, thereby regulating the transcriptional activity of p53. DNA damage also results in the formation of so-called ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) that represent complexes of DNA damage sensor and repair proteins that accumulate at the sites of DNA damage, which are visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Co-localization of proteins in IRIFs, however, does not necessarily imply direct protein-protein interactions, as the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is limited. In situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) is a novel technique that allows the direct visualization of protein-protein interactions in cells and tissues with unprecedented specificity and sensitivity. This technique is based on the spatial proximity of specific antibodies binding to the proteins of interest. When the interrogated proteins are within ~40 nm an amplification reaction is triggered by oligonucleotides that are conjugated to the antibodies, and the amplification product is visualized by fluorescent labeling, yielding a signal that corresponds to the subcellular location of the interacting proteins. Using the established functional interaction between ATM and p53 as an example, it is demonstrated here how PLA can be used in suspension cell cultures to study the direct interactions between proteins that are integral parts of the DNA damage response.",28654064.txt,0
38103548,ClinGen guidance for use of the PP1/BS4 co-segregation and PP4 phenotype specificity criteria for sequence variant pathogenicity classification.,"The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology variant classification publication established a standard employed internationally to guide laboratories in variant assessment. Those recommendations included both pathogenic (PP1) and benign (BS4) criteria for evaluating the inheritance patterns of variants, but details of how to apply those criteria at appropriate evidence levels were sparse. Several publications have since attempted to provide additional guidance, but anecdotally, this issue is still challenging. Additionally, it is not clear that those prior efforts fully distinguished disease-gene identification considerations from variant pathogenicity considerations nor did they address autosomal-recessive and X-linked inheritance. Here, we have taken a mixed inductive and deductive approach to this problem using real diseases as examples. We have developed a practical heuristic for genetic co-segregation evidence and have also determined that the specific phenotype criterion (PP4) is inseparably coupled to the co-segregation criterion. We have also determined that negative evidence at one locus constitutes positive evidence for other loci for disorders with locus heterogeneity. Finally, we provide a points-based system for evaluating phenotype and co-segregation as evidence types to support or refute a locus and show how that can be integrated into the Bayesian framework now used for variant classification and consistent with the 2015 guidelines.",38103548.txt,0
30997549,[Pituitary adenomas].,"Despite characteristic symptoms the diagnosis of clinically relevant pituitary adenomas is often delayed until an advanced stage due to the rarity of the disease. The typical clinical manifestations are presented in this review article. The recent discovery of the USP8 mutation in Cushing's disease and of X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG) syndrome in early onset gigantism were milestones in the search for the molecular etiology of pituitary adenomas. The triad of endocrinological, radiological and ophthalmological diagnostics are the main pillars for the diagnostic work-up of pituitary adenomas. The standard treatment modalities, which include surgery, medical treatment and irradiation, have been further developed and refined. For transsphenoidal excision of pituitary adenomas, microsurgery and endoscopy are two equivalent surgical techniques with relatively few complications. Surgery represents the first-line treatment of pituitary adenomas. Prolactinomas are an exception as the medical treatment with dopamine agonists is highly efficient. Nowadays, new medical treatment options are available for acromegaly and Cushing's disease and are used for second-line treatment. The alkylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide is used for the first-line chemotherapy of rare aggressively growing pituitary adenomas. Irradiation is indicated if surgical and medical treatment options are insufficiently successful. Stereotactic one-stage irradiation (radiosurgery) is especially suitable for well-demarcated invasive residual or recurrent adenomas in the cavernous sinus. A new development is hypofractionated radiosurgery for protection of structures at risk. Fractionated irradiation is necessary with large radiation volumes and for pituitary adenomas with a close proximity to the optic tract.",30997549.txt,1
29540686,A non-conserved amino acid variant regulates differential signalling between human and mouse CD28.,"CD28 superagonistic antibodies (CD28SAb) can preferentially activate and expand immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) in mice. However, pre-clinical trials assessing CD28SAbs for the therapy of autoimmune diseases reveal severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome in humans, thereby implying the existence of distinct signalling abilities between human and mouse CD28. Here, we show that a single amino acid variant within the C-terminal proline-rich motif of human and mouse CD28 (P212 in human vs. A210 in mouse) regulates CD28-induced NF-kappaB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Moreover, this Y209APP212 sequence in humans is crucial for the association of CD28 with the Nck adaptor protein for actin cytoskeleton reorganisation events necessary for CD28 autonomous signalling. This study thus unveils different outcomes between human and mouse CD28 signalling to underscore the importance of species difference when transferring results from preclinical models to the bedside.",29540686.txt,0
28960434,Utility and limitations of exome sequencing in the molecular diagnosis of pediatric inherited platelet disorders.,"Inherited platelet disorders (IPD) are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders that affect platelet number and function and often predispose to other significant medical complications. In spite of the identification of over 50 IPD disease-associated genes, a molecular diagnosis is only identified in a minority (10%) of affected patients without a clinically suspected etiology. We studied a cohort of 21 pediatric patients with suspected IPDs by exome sequencing (ES) to: (1) examine the performance of the exome test for IPD genes, (2) determine if this exome-wide diagnostic test provided a higher diagnostic yield than has been previously reported, (3) to evaluate the frequency of variants of uncertain significance identified, and (4) to identify candidate variants for functional evaluation in patients with an uncertain or negative diagnosis. We established a high priority gene list of 53 genes, evaluated exome capture kit performance, and determined the coverage for these genes and disease-related variants. We identified likely disease causing variants in 5 of the 21 probands (23.8%) and variants of uncertain significance in 52% of patients studied. In conclusion, ES has the potential to molecularly diagnose causes of IPD, and to identify candidate genes for functional evaluation. Robust exome sequencing also requires that coverage of genes known to be associated with clinical findings of interest need to be carefully examined and supplemented if necessary. Clinicians who undertake ES should understand the limitations of the test and the full significance of results that may be returned.",28960434.txt,0

31209437,[Application of U-shaped convolutional neural network in auto segmentation and reconstruction of 3D prostate model in laparoscopic prostatectomy navigation].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of intraoperative cognitive navigation on laparoscopic radical prostatectomy using 3D prostatic models created by U-shaped convolutional neural network (U-net) and reconstructed through Medical Image Interaction Tool Kit (MITK) platform. METHODS: A total of 5 000 pieces of prostate cancer magnetic resonance (MR) imaging discovery sets with manual annotations were used to train a modified U-net, and a set of clinically demand-oriented, stable and efficient full convolutional neural network algorithm was constructed. The MR images were cropped and segmented automatically by using modified U-net, and the segmentation data were automatically reconstructed using MITK platform according to our own protocols. The modeling data were output as STL format, and the prostate models were simultaneously displayed on an android tablet during the operation to help achieving cognitive navigation. RESULTS: Based on original U-net architecture, we established a modified U-net from a 201-case MR imaging training set. The network performance was tested and compared with human segmentations and other segmentation networks by using one certain testing data set. Auto segmentation of multi-structures (such as prostate, prostate tumors, seminal vesicles, rectus, neurovascular bundles and dorsal venous complex) were successfully achieved. Secondary automatic 3D reconstruction had been carried out through MITK platform. During the surgery, 3D models of prostatic area were simultaneously displayed on an android tablet, and the cognitive navigation was successfully achieved. Intra-operation organ visualization demonstrated the structural relationships among the key structures in great detail and the degree of tumor invasion was visualized directly. CONCLUSION: The modified U-net was able to achieve automatic segmentations of important structures of prostate area. Secondary 3D model reconstruction and demonstration could provide intraoperative visualization of vital structures of prostate area, which could help achieve cognitive fusion navigation for surgeons. The application of these techniques could finally reduce positive surgical margin rates, and may improve the efficacy and oncological outcomes of laparoscopic prostatectomy.",31209437.txt,1
36926316,Disruption of estrogen receptor beta's DNA binding domain impairs its tumor suppressive effects in triple negative breast cancer.,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive sub-type of the disease which accounts for a disproportionately high percentage of breast cancer morbidities and mortalities. For these reasons, a better understanding of TNBC biology is required and the development of novel therapeutic approaches are critically needed. Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) is a reported tumor suppressor that is expressed in approximately 20% of primary TNBC tumors, where it is associated with favorable prognostic features and patient outcomes. Previous studies have shown that ERβ mediates the assembly of co-repressor complexes on DNA to inhibit the expression of multiple growth promoting genes and to suppress the ability of oncogenic transcription factors to drive cancer progression. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ERβ elicits its anti-cancer effects, we developed MDA-MB-231 cells that inducibly express a mutant form of ERβ incapable of directly binding DNA. We demonstrate that disruption of ERβ's direct interaction with DNA abolishes its ability to regulate the expression of well characterized immediate response genes and renders it unable to suppress TNBC cell proliferation. Loss of DNA binding also diminishes the ability of ERβ to suppress oncogenic NFκB signaling even though it still physically associates with NFκB and other critical co-factors. These findings enhance our understanding of how ERβ functions in this disease and provide a model system that can be utilized to further investigate the mechanistic processes by which ERβ elicits its anti-cancer effects.",36926316.txt,1
25246615,Mastl is required for timely activation of APC/C in meiosis I and Cdk1 reactivation in meiosis II.,"In mitosis, the Greatwall kinase (called microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase like [Mastl] in mammals) is essential for prometaphase entry or progression by suppressing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. PP2A suppression in turn leads to high levels of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation. We have used a mouse model with an oocyte-specific deletion of Mastl to show that Mastl-null oocytes resume meiosis I and reach metaphase I normally but that the onset and completion of anaphase I are delayed. Moreover, after the completion of meiosis I, Mastl-null oocytes failed to enter meiosis II (MII) because they reassembled a nuclear structure containing decondensed chromatin. Our results show that Mastl is required for the timely activation of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome to allow meiosis I exit and for the rapid rise of Cdk1 activity that is needed for the entry into MII in mouse oocytes.",25246615.txt,0
27311832,CREBBP mutations in individuals without Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome phenotype.,"Mutations in CREBBP cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. By using exome sequencing, and by using Sanger in one patient, CREBBP mutations were detected in 11 patients who did not, or only in a very limited manner, resemble Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. The combined facial signs typical for Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome were absent, none had broad thumbs, and three had only somewhat broad halluces. All had apparent developmental delay (being the reason for molecular analysis); five had short stature and seven had microcephaly. The facial characteristics were variable; main characteristics were short palpebral fissures, telecanthi, depressed nasal ridge, short nose, anteverted nares, short columella, and long philtrum. Six patients had autistic behavior, and two had self-injurious behavior. Other symptoms were recurrent upper airway infections (n = 5), feeding problems (n = 7) and impaired hearing (n = 7). Major malformations occurred infrequently. All patients had a de novo missense mutation in the last part of exon 30 or beginning of exon 31 of CREBBP, between base pairs 5,128 and 5,614 (codons 1,710 and 1,872). No missense or truncating mutations in this region have been described to be associated with the classical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome phenotype. No functional studies have (yet) been performed, but we hypothesize that the mutations disturb protein-protein interactions by altering zinc finger function. We conclude that patients with missense mutations in this specific CREBBP region show a phenotype that differs substantially from that in patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and may prove to constitute one (or more) separate entities.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27311832.txt,0

Because of the clinical overlap between NCFCs, genetic analysis of NF1 is necessary to confirm a clinical diagnosis NF1. This report describes the clinical and genetic findings of 18 years of NF1 molecular diagnostics in the Netherlands. A pathogenic mutation was found in 59.3% (1178/1985) of the index patients, mostly de novo (73.8%). The majority of the index patients (64.3%) fulfilled the National Institute of Health NF1 criteria, a pathogenic mutation was found in 80.9% of these patients. Seventy-four percent of the index patients with an NF1 pathogenic mutation and not fulfilling the NF1 criteria is <12 years, in agreement with the fact that some NF1 symptoms appear after puberty. Genotype-phenotype correlations were studied for 527 index patients. NF1 patients with a type 1 microdeletion have a sixfold higher risk of special education vs NF1 patients with an intragenic mutation. No evidently milder NF1 phenotype for patients with a missense mutation was observed. Forty-six prenatal analyses were performed in 28 (2.4%) families, of which 29 (63%) showed heterozygosity for the familial pathogenic mutation. This indicates that there is a need for prenatal NF1 testing.",23656349.txt,0
29884702,mTOR Complex 1 Signaling Regulates the Generation and Function of Central and Effector Foxp3+ Regulatory T Cells.,"The mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as a critical integrator of signals from the immune microenvironment capable of regulating T cell activation, differentiation, and function. The precise role of mTOR in the control of regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and function is complex. Pharmacologic inhibition and genetic deletion of mTOR promotes the generation of Tregs even under conditions that would normally promote generation of effector T cells. Alternatively, mTOR activity has been observed to be increased in Tregs, and the genetic deletion of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-scaffold protein Raptor inhibits Treg function. In this study, by employing both pharmacologic inhibitors and genetically altered T cells, we seek to clarify the role of mTOR in Tregs. Our studies demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR during T cell activation promotes the generation of long-lived central Tregs with a memory-like phenotype in mice. Metabolically, these central memory Tregs possess enhanced spare respiratory capacity, similar to CD8+ memory cells. Alternatively, the generation of effector Tregs (eTregs) requires mTOR function. Indeed, genetic deletion of Rptor leads to the decreased expression of ICOS and PD-1 on the eTregs. Overall, our studies define a subset of mTORC1hi eTregs and mTORC1lo central Tregs.",29884702.txt,0
25637637,Proteins of the mitotic checkpoint and spindle are related to chromosomal instability and unfavourable prognosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.,"AIMS: To study the immunoexpression of proteins related to the mitotic checkpoint (cell division cycle 20 (CDC20), mitotic arrest deficient 2 (MAD2)) and the mitotic spindle (Aurora-B) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: Protein expression was analysed in bone marrow tissue samples from 40 patients with MDS using immunohistochemistry. Prognostic markers (transfusion dependency, depth of cytopenias, chromosomal abnormalities and survival) were also studied. RESULTS: Higher MAD2 expression was observed among patients with platelets <50x10(9)/L than among patients with platelets >=50x10(9)/L (42.6+-22.8% vs 22.7+-19.1%, respectively). Higher CDC20 expression was identified among patients with three dysplasias compared with patients who presented with one or two dysplasias (33.9+-24.1% vs 10.5+-5.7% vs 12.8+-7.8%, respectively), among patients who exhibited a complex versus non-complex karyotype (50.0+-30.2% vs 18.4+-14%, respectively) and among patients with platelets <50x10(9)/L vs platelets >=50x10(9)/L (38.2+-26.2% vs 16.1+-12.4%, respectively). Higher Aurora-B expression was found in patients with an abnormal versus normal karyotype (21.2+-13.2% vs 7.5+-5.0%, respectively). High expression of MAD2 and CDC20 (>=50%) was associated with severe thrombocytopenia. We also found statistically significant differences in the overall survival rate when comparing different degrees of CDC20, MAD2 and Aurora-B protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that these proteins are associated with chromosomal abnormalities and poor prognosis in patients with MDS.",25637637.txt,0
30907473,Expandable Immunotherapeutic Nanoplatforms Engineered from Cytomembranes of Hybrid Cells Derived from Cancer and Dendritic Cells.,"Using the cytomembranes (FMs) of hybrid cells acquired from the fusion of cancer and dendritic cells (DCs), this study offers a biologically derived platform for the combination of immunotherapy and traditional oncotherapy approaches. Due to the immunoactivation implicated in the cellular fusion, FMs can effectively express whole cancer antigens and immunological co-stimulatory molecules for robust immunotherapy. FMs share the tumor's self-targeting character with the parent cancer cells. In bilateral tumor-bearing mouse models, the FM-coated nanophotosensitizer causes durable immunoresponse to inhibit the rebound of primary tumors post-nanophotosensitizer-induced photodynamic therapy (PDT). The FM-induced immunotherapy displays ultrahigh antitumor effects even comparable to that of PDT. On the other hand, PDT toward primary tumors enhances the immunotherapy-caused regression of the irradiation-free distant tumors. Consequently, both the primary and the distant tumors are almost completely eliminated. This tumor-specific immunotherapy-based nanoplatform is potentially expandable to multiple tumor types and readily equipped with diverse functions owing to the flexible nanoparticle options.",30907473.txt,1
36764880,Clinical utility of axillary nodal markers in breast cancer.,"De-escalation of axillary surgery for lymph node (LN) positive breast cancer is facilitated by marking involved nodes which, when removed with sentinel nodes constitute risk-adapted targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Whether after chemotherapy or for primary surgery, selected patients with biopsy-proven involvement of nodes may be eligible for axillary conservation. Likewise, impalpable recurrence or stage 4 patients with localised axillary disease may benefit. In these contexts, several devices are used to mark biopsied nodes to facilitate their accurate surgical removal. We report our experience using the paramagnetic MAGSEED (Endomag®, Cambridge, UK).
Local approval (BR2021_149) was obtained to interrogate a prospective database of all axillary markers. The primary endpoint was successful removal of the marked LN.
Of 241 markers (in 221 patients) inserted between October 2018 and July 2022, all were retrieved. Of 74 patients who had Magseeds® inserted after completion of NACT (involved nodes initially marked using an UltraCor™Twirl™ marker), the Magseeds® were found outside the node in neighbouring axillary tissue in 18 (24.3%) patients. When Magseeds® were placed at commencement of NACT in 54 patients, in only 1 (1.8%) was the marker found outside the node - a statistically significantly lower rate (Chi<sup>2</sup> 10.7581 p = 0.001038). For 'primary TAD' patients and those localised for recurrent or stage IV disease, all 93 had the Magseed® found within the biopsied node.
This series supports our axillary nodal marking technique as safe and reliable. For TAD following NACT, placement at the start of treatment led to a significantly higher localisation rate.",36764880.txt,1
31512231,Exosome DNA: Critical regulator of tumor immunity and a diagnostic biomarker.,"Nanosized cellular vesicles ""exosome"" contains a variety of biological cargo including DNA fragments from cell-of-origin. Despite its biological stability and clinical utility in tumor diagnosis, exosome DNA (ExoDNA) is very little studied as compare with exosome RNA. Cytoplasmic accumulation of damaged DNA from nucleus and mitochondria often leads to its packaging in exosomes by yet unknown pathways. ExoDNA modulates tumor immunity via paracrine interactions and activation of cytosolic DNA sensor pathways, for example, STING, cGAS, and so forth in specific immune cell subsets. In addition to priming tumor immunity, ExoDNA is also emerging as a critical regulator of check-point immunotherapy. As a useful diagnostic biomaterial, ExoDNA contains a variety of clinically relevant tumor-specific mutations representing multiple genes (e.g., EGFR, BRAF, RAS, IDH, and HER2), thus making it a promising ""liquid biopsy"" material for therapy recommendations. Hence, ExoDNA in addition to tumor immunity modulation, is also emerging as a suitable diagnostic material for personalized therapy in cancer. Here, we review the current status of ExoDNA research and its potential uses in tumor biology.",31512231.txt,1
31269567,[A clinical study of Proteus syndrome caused by a mosaic somatic mutation in AKT1 gene].,"Objective: Proteus syndrome is a rare disease. The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinical characteristics and gene mutations of Proteus syndrome with a case report and relevant literature review. Methods: Clinical data of the patient with Proteus syndrome were collected in detail and biochemical measurements and radiological examinations were conducted. Tissues from phalanges with lesions were obtained to extract DNA, and Sanger sequencing of AKT1 gene was carried on. The pathogenic mutation was further tested in peripheral blood samples of the patient, his parents and 250 healthy volunteers. Orthopaedic surgery was performed on the affected limbs of the patient. Results: The patient was presented with progressive overgrowth of the right extremity, scoliosis, cerebral connective tissue nevus and lower extremity venous. A heterozygous mutation of AKT1 gene (c. 49G>A) was identified in DNA extracted from the affected bone tissue of the patient, but not be found in genomic DNA of peripheral blood samples from the patient, his parents and 250 healthy volunteers. Movement function of the affected limb improved significantly after the operations. Conclusions: The prominent features of Proteus syndrome are overgrowth of one extremity and cerebral connective tissue nevus. A mosaic somatic mutation of AKT1 gene is one of the pathogenic mutations for Proteus syndrome, and orthopedic surgery may be a good way to improve symptoms of the disease.",31269567.txt,0
24291262,Dynamic recruitment of active proteasomes into polyglutamine initiated inclusion bodies.,"Neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease are hallmarked by neuronal intracellular inclusion body formation. Whether proteasomes are irreversibly recruited into inclusion bodies in these protein misfolding disorders is a controversial subject. In addition, it has been proposed that the proteasomes may become clogged by the aggregated protein fragments, leading to impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we show by fluorescence pulse-chase experiments in living cells that proteasomes are dynamically and reversibly recruited into inclusion bodies. As these recruited proteasomes remain catalytically active and accessible to substrates, our results challenge the concept of proteasome sequestration and impairment in Huntington's disease, and support the reported absence of proteasome impairment in mouse models of Huntington's disease.",24291262.txt,0
30904619,Metabolomics of neonatal blood spots reveal distinct phenotypes of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and potential effects of early-life nutrition.,"Early-life exposures are believed to influence the incidence of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Archived neonatal blood spots (NBS), collected within the first days of life, offer a means to investigate small molecules that reflect early-life exposures. Using untargeted metabolomics, we compared abundances of small-molecule features in extracts of NBS punches from 332 children that later developed ALL and 324 healthy controls. Subjects were stratified by early (1-5 y) and late (6-14 y) diagnosis. Mutually-exclusive sets of metabolic features - representing putative lipids and fatty acids - were associated with ALL, including 9 and 19 metabolites in the early- and late-diagnosis groups, respectively. In the late-diagnosis group, a prominent cluster of features with apparent 18:2 fatty-acid chains suggested that newborn exposure to the essential nutrient, linoleic acid, increased ALL risk. Interestingly, abundances of these putative 18:2 lipids were greater in infants who were fed formula rather than breast milk (colostrum) and increased with the mother's pre-pregnancy body mass index. These results suggest possible etiologic roles of newborn nutrition in late-diagnosis ALL.",30904619.txt,1
36690721,Prognostic refinement of NSMP high-risk endometrial cancers using oestrogen receptor immunohistochemistry.,"Risk-assessment of endometrial cancer (EC) is based on clinicopathological factors and molecular subgroup. It is unclear whether adding hormone receptor expression, L1CAM expression or CTNNB1 status yields prognostic refinement.
Paraffin-embedded tumour samples of women with high-risk EC (HR-EC) from the PORTEC-3 trial (n = 424), and a Dutch prospective clinical cohort called MST (n = 256), were used. All cases were molecularly classified. Expression of L1CAM, ER and PR were analysed by whole-slide immunohistochemistry and CTNNB1 mutations were assessed with a next-generation sequencing. Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank tests and Cox's proportional hazard models were used for survival analysis.
In total, 648 HR-EC were included. No independent prognostic value of ER, PR, L1CAM, and CTNNB1 was found, while age, stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy had an independent impact on risk of recurrence. Subgroup-analysis showed that only in NSMP HR-EC, ER-positivity was independently associated with a reduced risk of recurrence (HR 0.33, 95%CI 0.15-0.75).
We confirmed the prognostic impact of the molecular classification, age, stage, and adjuvant CTRT in a large cohort of high-risk EC. ER-positivity is a strong favourable prognostic factor in NSMP HR-EC and identifies a homogeneous subgroup of NSMP tumours. Assessment of ER status in high-risk NSMP EC is feasible in clinical practice and could improve risk stratification and treatment.",36690721.txt,1
38345107,Similarities and differences of interstitial lung disease associated with pathogenic variants in SFTPC and ABCA3 in adults.,"Variants in surfactant genes SFTPC or ABCA3 are responsible for interstitial lung disease (ILD) in children and adults, with few studies in adults.
We conducted a multicentre retrospective study of all consecutive adult patients diagnosed with ILD associated with variants in SFTPC or ABCA3 in the French rare pulmonary diseases network, OrphaLung. Variants and chest computed tomography (CT) features were centrally reviewed.
We included 36 patients (median age: 34 years, 20 males), 22 in the SFTPC group and 14 in the ABCA3 group. Clinical characteristics were similar between groups. Baseline median FVC was 59% ([52-72]) and DLco was 44% ([35-50]). An unclassifiable pattern of fibrosing ILD was the most frequent on chest CT, found in 85% of patients, however with a distinct phenotype with ground-glass opacities and/or cysts. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and usual interstitial pneumonia were the most common histological patterns in the ABCA3 group and in the SFTPC group, respectively. Annually, FVC and DL<sub>CO</sub> declined by 1.87% and 2.43% in the SFTPC group, respectively, and by 0.72% and 0.95% in the ABCA3 group, respectively (FVC, p = 0.014 and DL<sub>CO</sub> , p = 0.004 for comparison between groups). Median time to death or lung transplantation was 10 years in the SFTPC group and was not reached at the end of follow-up in the ABCA3 group.
SFTPC and ABCA3-associated ILD present with a distinct phenotype and prognosis. A radiologic pattern of fibrosing ILD with ground-glass opacities and/or cysts is frequently found in these rare conditions.",38345107.txt,0
30908656,High-level expression of PRSS3 correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Serine protease-3 (PRSS3) is a known contributor to the genesis and development of malignant tumors, although its role in gastric cancer (GC) is still unclear. METHODS: PRSS3 expression in GC tissue samples and its relationship with clinicopathological features were analyzed. Effects of GC cellular responses to the introduction of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated interference with tumor PRSS3 expression were also assessed. RESULTS: PRSS3 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues, and PRSS3 protein levels were higher in tumors that developed metastases soon after the surgery compared with those that remained metastasis-free. High expression of PRSS3 was associated with tumor N staging and independently predictive of postoperative prognosis in patients with GC. The V1 variant of PRSS3 was primarily detected in GC tissue and cell lines, the others (V2-V4) being scarcely detectable. Methylation and demethylation drugs had no impact on expression levels of any PRSS3 transcriptional variant. The downregulated PRSS3 expression suppressed GC cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: PRSS3 appears to act as an oncogene of GC. High PRSS3 expression portends postoperative metastasis, serving as an effective biomarker of poor therapeutic outcomes.",30908656.txt,1
28880435,Thrombocytopenia and CD34 expression is decoupled from alpha-granule deficiency with mutation of the first growth factor-independent 1B zinc finger.,"Essentials The phenotypes of different growth factor-independent 1B (GFI1B) variants are not established. GFI1B variants produce heterogeneous clinical phenotypes dependent on the site of mutation. Mutation of the first non-DNA-binding zinc-finger causes a mild platelet and clinical phenotype. GFI1B regulates the CD34 promoter; platelet CD34 expression is an indicator of GFI1B mutation. SUMMARY: Background Mutation of the growth factor-independent 1B (GFI1B) fifth DNA-binding zinc-finger domain causes macrothrombocytopenia and alpha-granule deficiency leading to clinical bleeding. The phenotypes associated with GFI1B variants disrupting non-DNA-binding zinc-fingers remain uncharacterized. Objectives To determine the functional and phenotypic consequences of GFI1B variants disrupting non-DNA-binding zinc-finger domains. Methods The GFI1B C168F variant and a novel GFI1B c.2520 + 1_2520 + 8delGTGGGCAC splice variant were identified in four unrelated families. Phenotypic features, DNA-binding properties and transcriptional effects were determined and compared with those in individuals with a GFI1B H294 fs mutation of the fifth DNA-binding zinc-finger. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived megakaryocytes were generated to facilitate disease modeling. Results The DNA-binding GFI1B variant C168F, which is predicted to disrupt the first non-DNA-binding zinc-finger domain, is associated with macrothrombocytopenia without alpha-granule deficiency or bleeding symptoms. A GFI1B splice variant, c.2520 + 1_2520 + 8delGTGGGCAC, which generates a short GFI1B isoform that lacks non-DNA-binding zinc-fingers 1 and 2, is associated with increased platelet CD34 expression only, without quantitative or morphologic platelet abnormalities. GFI1B represses the CD34 promoter, and this repression is attenuated by different GFI1B zinc-finger mutations, suggesting that deregulation of CD34 expression occurs at a direct transcriptional level. Patient-specific iPSC-derived megakaryocytes phenocopy these observations. Conclusions Disruption of GFI1B non-DNA-binding zinc-finger 1 is associated with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia without alpha-granule deficiency or bleeding symptomatology, indicating that the site of GFI1B mutation has important phenotypic implications. Platelet CD34 expression appears to be a common feature of perturbed GFI1B function, and may have diagnostic utility.",28880435.txt,0
36926333,"Unique profile on the progress free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the Qujing area, Southwest China.","China's southwestern region, Qujing, harbors a high incidence of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and related mortality. This study was designed to reveal the impact of an immune-related prognostic signature (IRPS) on advanced NSCLC in the Qujing.
Tissue specimens from an independent cohort of 37 patients with advanced NSCLC were retrospectively evaluated to determine the relationship between the IRPS estimated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and clinical outcome. To compare the IRPS in tissue and the clinical outcomes between Qujing and non-Qujing populations, we analyzed datasets of 23 patients with advanced NSCLC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, an independent cohort (n=111) of blood specimens was retrospectively analyzed to determine the relationship between the IRPS and clinical outcome. Finally, we evaluated the utility of the blood IRPS in classifying 24 patients with advanced NSCLC who might benefit from immunotherapy.
In cohort 1, the Qujing population with tTMB-H (≥ 10 mutations/Mb) or KRAS mutations had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37, 0.14 to 0.97, <i>P</i> = 0.04; HR 0.23, 0.08 to 0.66, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and overall survival (OS) (HR 0.05, 0.01 to 0.35, <i>P</i> < 0.01; HR 0.22, 0.07 to 0.66, <i>P</i> < 0.01). In cohort 2 of the Qujing population, bTMB-H (≥ 6 mutations per Mb) and KRAS mutations were related to PFS (HR 0.59, 0.36 to 0.99, <i>P</i> = 0.04; HR 0.50, 0.26 to 0.98, <i>P</i> = 0.04) and OS (HR 0.58, 0.35 to 0.96, <i>P</i> = 0.03; HR 0.48, 0.25 to 0.93, <i>P</i> = 0.03). Notably, the Qujing population with bTMB-H had superior PFS (HR 0.32, 0.09 to 1.09, <i>P</i> = 0.01), OS (HR 0.33, 0.10 to 1.13, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and objective response rates (ORRs) (83.3% vs. 14.3% vs. 20.0%, <i>P <</i>0.01) to immunotherapy than other populations.
These findings show that tTMB, bTMB and KRAS mutations appear to be independent validated IRPSs that predict the clinical outcomes of Qujing populations with advanced NSCLC and that bTMB may be used as a reliable IRPS to predict the clinical benefit from anti-PD-1 therapies among populations from Qujing with advanced NSCLC.",36926333.txt,1
30317357,Xeroderma Pigmentosum - Cockayne Syndrome Complex (XP-CS) - Another case.,"We present the case of a 3-year old girl with clinical manifestations typical of XP-CS, an extremely rare combination of Xeroderma Pigmentosum and Cockayne Syndrome. She had a swelling above the upper lip and multiple brown spots on her face, neck, arms and back. She was globally delayed, deaf, dumb and photophobic. MRI brain showed mild cerebral atrophy and bilateral demyelination. De Sanctis Cacchione variant (dSCS) and Rothmund Thomson syndrome (RTS), which were among the differential diagnosis were ruled out upon careful evaluation. Supportive treatment was given and regular checkups were recommended to monitor the progression of the disease but our patient did not show up for the follow up.

30224494,Influenza hemagglutinin membrane anchor.,"Viruses with membranes fuse them with cellular membranes, to transfer their genomes into cells at the beginning of infection. For Influenza virus, the membrane glycoprotein involved in fusion is the hemagglutinin (HA), the 3D structure of which is known from X-ray crystallographic studies. The soluble ectodomain fragments used in these studies lacked the ""membrane anchor"" portion of the molecule. Since this region has a role in membrane fusion, we have determined its structure by analyzing the intact, full-length molecule in a detergent micelle, using cryo-EM. We have also compared the structures of full-length HA-detergent micelles with full-length HA-Fab complex detergent micelles, to describe an infectivity-neutralizing monoclonal Fab that binds near the ectodomain membrane anchor junction. We determine a high-resolution HA structure which compares favorably in detail with the structure of the ectodomain seen by X-ray crystallography; we detect, clearly, all five carbohydrate side chains of HA; and we find that the ectodomain is joined to the membrane anchor by flexible, eight-residue-long, linkers. The linkers extend into the detergent micelle to join a central triple-helical structure that is a major component of the membrane anchor.",30224494.txt,0
36628811,Fertility Preferences and Practices Among Young Women With Breast Cancer: Germline Genetic Carriers Versus Noncarriers.,"Young women with breast cancer who carry germline genetic pathogenic variants may face distinct fertility concerns, yet limited data exist comparing fertility preferences and practices between carriers and noncarriers.
Participants in the Young Women's Breast Cancer Study (NCT01468246), a prospective cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer at ≤40 years, who completed a modified Fertility Issues Survey were included in this analysis.
Of 1052 eligible participants, 118 (11%) tested positive for a pathogenic variant. Similar proportions (P = .23) of carriers (46%, [54/118]) and noncarriers (37%, [346/934]) desired more biologic children prediagnosis, and desire decreased similarly postdiagnosis (carriers, 30% [35/118] vs. noncarriers, 26% [244/934], P = .35). Among those desiring children postdiagnosis (n = 279), concern about cancer risk heritability was more common among carriers (74% [26/35] vs. noncarriers, 36% [88/244], P < .01). Carriers were more likely to report that concern about cancer risk heritability contributed to a lack of certainty or interest in future pregnancies (20% [16/81] vs. noncarriers, 7% [49/674], P = .001). Similar proportions (P = .65) of carriers (36% [43/118]) and noncarriers (38% [351/934]) were somewhat or very concerned about infertility post-treatment; utilization of fertility preservation strategies was also similar (carriers, 14% [17/118] vs. noncarriers, 12% [113/934], P = .78).
Carriers were similarly concerned about future fertility and as likely to pursue fertility preservation as noncarriers. Concern about cancer risk heritability was more frequent among carriers and impacted decisions not to pursue future pregnancies for some, underscoring the importance of counseling regarding strategies to prevent transmission to offspring, including preimplantation genetic testing.",36628811.txt,1

31592503,Integrative Molecular Analysis of Patients With Advanced and Metastatic Cancer.,"PURPOSE: We developed a precision medicine program for patients with advanced cancer using integrative whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred fifteen patients with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors were prospectively enrolled, and paired tumor/normal sequencing was performed. Seven hundred fifty-nine tumors from 515 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Most frequent tumor types were prostate (19.4%), brain (16.5%), bladder (15.4%), and kidney cancer (9.2%). Most frequently altered genes were TP53 (33%), CDKN2A (11%), APC (10%), KTM2D (8%), PTEN (8%), and BRCA2 (8%). Pathogenic germline alterations were present in 10.7% of patients, most frequently CHEK2 (1.9%), BRCA1 (1.5%), BRCA2 (1.5%), and MSH6 (1.4%). Novel gene fusions were identified, including a RBM47-CDK12 fusion in a metastatic prostate cancer sample. The rate of clinically relevant alterations was 39% by whole-exome sequencing, which was improved by 16% by adding RNA sequencing. In patients with more than one sequenced tumor sample (n = 146), 84.62% of actionable mutations were concordant. CONCLUSION: Integrative analysis may uncover informative alterations for an advanced pan-cancer patient population. These alterations are consistent in spatially and temporally heterogeneous samples.",31592503.txt,1
29930110,Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain.,"Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.",29930110.txt,0

As breast cancer is one of the most frequent tumors, many of these patients may present with G6PD deficiency prior treatment without notice. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a woman deficient for G6PD with the diagnosis of Stage IIIB (cT4d cN1 cM0) HER2-enriched early breast cancer. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: The patient underwent neoadjuvance with trastuzumab and anthracycline-free chemotherapy, based on docetaxel (75 mg/m2, 120 mg) and carboplatin (AUC 5, 560 mg). She did not present hemolytic crisis and no blood transfusions were needed. She achieved a good pathologic response and completed one-year adjuvant trastuzumab without incidences. DISCUSSION: Although the role of HER2 and trastuzumab in oxidative stress is not yet completely understood, we suggest that trastuzumab may be a suitable agent for treatment in patients with HER2-enriched breast cancer in a non-oxidative chemotherapy scheme, with acceptable responses and no triggering hemolytic crisis.",31260379.txt,1
27241812,Angiopoietin-2 mediates thrombin-induced monocyte adhesion and endothelial permeability.,"UNLABELLED: Essentials Mechanism of thrombin-induced inflammation is not fully understood. Thrombin induced monocyte adhesion and barrier loss require Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). Ang-2 mediates vessel leakage and monocyte adhesion through SHP-2/p38MAPK pathway. Calcium dependent SHP2/p38MAPK activation regulates Ang-2 expression through a feedback loop. SUMMARY: Background Thrombin imparts an inflammatory phenotype to the endothelium by promoting increased monocyte adhesion and vascular permeability. However, the molecular players that govern these events are incompletely understood. Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) has a role, if any, in regulating inflammatory signals initiated by thrombin. Methods Assessment of vascular leakage by Miles assay was performed by intra-dermal injection on the foot paw. Surface levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were determined by flow cytometry. Overexpression, knockdown and phosphorylation of proteins were determined by Western blotting. Results In time-course experiments, thrombin-stimulated Ang-2 up-regulation, peaked prior to the expression of adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (HUVECs). Knockdown of Ang-2 blocked both thrombin-induced monocyte adhesion and ICAM-1 expression. In addition, Ang-2(-/-) mice displayed defective vascular leakage when treated with thrombin. Introducing Ang-2 protein in Ang-2(-/-) mice failed to recover a wild-type phenotype. Mechanistically, Ang-2 appears to regulate the thrombin-activated calcium spike that is required for tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and p38 MAPK activation. Further, down-regulation of SHP2 attenuated both thrombin-induced Ang-2 expression and monocyte adhesion. Down-regulation of the adaptor protein Gab1, a co-activator of SHP2, as well as overexpression of the Gab1 mutant incapable of interacting with SHP2 (YFGab1), inhibited thrombin-mediated effects, including downstream activation of p38 MAPK, which in turn was required for Ang-2 expression. Conclusions The data establish an essential role of the Gab1/SHP2/p38MAPK signaling pathway and Ang-2 in regulating thrombin-induced monocyte adhesion and vascular leakage.",27241812.txt,0
31300532,Dataset for the reporting of renal biopsy for tumour: recommendations from the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR).,"The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) has developed a suite of detailed datasets for international implementation. These datasets are based on the reporting protocols developed by the Royal College of Pathologists (UK), The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the College of American Pathologists, with modifications undertaken by international expert groups appointed according to ICCR protocols. The dataset for the reporting of renal biopsy for tumour is designed to provide a structured reporting template containing minimum data recording key elements suitable for international use. In formulating the dataset, the ICCR panel incorporated recommendations from the 2012 Vancouver Consensus Conference of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) and the 2016 edition of the WHO Bluebook on tumours of the urinary and male genital systems. Reporting elements were divided into Required (Core) and Recommended (Non-core) components of the report. Required elements are as follows: specimen laterality, histological tumour type, WHO/ISUP histological tumour grade, sarcomatoid morphology, rhabdoid morphology, necrosis, lymphovascular invasion and coexisting pathology in non-neoplastic kidney. Recommended reporting elements are as follows: operative procedure, tumour site(s), histological tumour subtype and details of ancillary studies. In particular, it is noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation studies may assist in diagnosing translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and in distinguishing oncocytoma and eosinophilic chromophobe RCC. It is anticipated that the implementation of this dataset into routine clinical practice will facilitate uniformity of pathology reporting worldwide. This, in turn, should have a positive impact on patient treatment and the quality of demographic information held by cancer registries.",31300532.txt,1
30941953,First-line treatment choices of Turkish medical oncologists in metastatic colorectal cancer: A survey study.,"PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the World. RAS-BRAF mutational status and primary tumor location are also important factors for the selection of optimal combinations therapies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the Turkish oncologists' treatment decisions depending on tumor location and mutational status in metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: An online survey link was sent to the medical oncologists who are registered to Turkish Society of Medical Oncology via e-mail and mobile applications. RESULTS: Ninety-four oncologists (85.5%) reported that tumor localization affects their treatment modality. In RAS-BRAF wild type left colon tumors, Turkish oncologists mostly use chemotherapy and anti-EGFR therapy (90.1%) for the first-line treatment, while on the right side, oncologists favored anti-VEGF therapy in combination with chemotherapy (65.5%). BRAF-mutant tumors in left colon had nearly the same rates of treatment tendency with both anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR antibodies in combination with chemotherapy, while in right-sided tumors the main treatment selection of the participants was anti-VEGF-based treatment (83.6%). In RAS-mutant patients, a great number of oncologists selected anti-VEGF-based treatment. On the right and left colon tumors, anti-VEGF treatment options ratios were 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. Maintenance treatment is usually preferred by oncologists in both anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR-based treatment. CONCLUSION: Turkish oncologists are considering tumor sidedness as an indicator for treatment individualization of patients. The selection of monoclonal antibodies is being affected by tumor localization and mutation status.",30941953.txt,1
30943982,Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR promotes exosome secretion by regulating RAB35 and SNAP23 in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that tumor cells release a large amount of exosomes loaded with cargos during tumorigenesis. Exosome secretion is a multi-step process regulated by certain related molecules. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. However, the role of lncRNA HOTAIR in regulating exosome secretion in HCC cells remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed the relationship between HOTAIR expression and exosome secretion-related genes using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed to validate the effect of HOTAIR on exosome secretion. The transport of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) after overexpression of HOTAIR was detected by transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy analysis of cluster determinant 63 (CD63) with synaptosome associated protein 23 (SNAP23). The mechanism of HOTAIR's regulation of Ras-related protein Rab-35 (RAB35), vesicle associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3), and SNAP23 was assessed using confocal co-localization analysis, phosphorylation assays, and rescue experiments. RESULTS: We found an enrichment of exosome secretion-related genes in the HOTAIR high expression group. HOTAIR promoted the release of exosomes by inducing MVB transport to the plasma membrane. HOTAIR regulated RAB35 expression and localization, which controlled the docking process. Moreover, HOTAIR facilitated the final step of fusion by influencing VAMP3 and SNAP23 colocalization. In addition, we validated that HOTAIR induced the phosphorylation of SNAP23 via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a novel function of lncRNA HOTAIR in promoting exosome secretion from HCC cells and provided a new understanding of lncRNAs in tumor cell biology.",30943982.txt,1
28845713,Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for children with immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to assess the efficacy and safety of Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPOras) for pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library from their earliest records to January 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Primary outcomes were durable response and clinically significant bleeding. Secondary outcomes were overall response, overall bleeding events, the use of rescue medication and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Five randomized RCTs (261participants) were included. Compared with placebo group, the proportion of patients achieving durable platelet response was significantly higher in Eltrombopag (P = 0.0004) or Romiplostim (P = 0.002) group, so was the overall response in Eltrombopag [RR = 2.64, 95% CI (1.58, 4.44)] or Romiplostim [RR = 5.05, 95% CI (2.21, 11.53)] group. Both clinically significant bleeding (P = 0.04) and total bleeding (P = 0.01) in Eltrombopag group were significantly less frequent than those in placebo group, while no significant difference between Romiplostim and placebo group. The proportion of patients receiving rescue medication, the incidence of overall AEs and serious AEs between TPO-receptor agonists and placebo group were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: TPOras might improve both durable and overall platelet response in pediatric ITP, compared with placebo.",28845713.txt,0
31244296,Identification of FLT3 and NPM1 Mutations in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.,"Objective: The most frequent acquired molecular abnormalities and important prognostic indicators in patientswith Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) are fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 gene (FLT3) and nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1)mutations. Our study aims to develop a cost effective and comprehensive in-house conventional PCR method fordetection of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835 and NPM1 mutations and to evaluate the frequency of these mutations in patientswith cytogenetically normal (CN) AML in our population. Methods: A total of 199 samples from AML patients (95women, 104 men) were included in the study. Mutation analyses were performed using polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and gene sequencing. Result: Sixty-eight patients were positive for the mutations. FLT3-ITD mutations weredetected in 32 patients (16.1%), followed by FLT3-D835 in 5 (2.5%) and NPM1 in 54 (27.1%). Double mutations ofNPM1 and FLT3-ITD were detected in 23 cases (11.6%). Assays validation were performed using Sanger sequencingand showed 100% concordance with in house method. Conclusion: The optimized in-house PCR assays for thedetection of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835 and NPM1 mutations in AML patients were robust, less labour intensive and costeffective. These assays can be used as diagnostic tools for mutation detection in AML patients since identification ofthese mutations are important for prognostication and optimization of patient care.",31244296.txt,1
31350329,A Pilot Study of Sirolimus in Subjects with Cowden Syndrome or Other Syndromes Characterized by Germline Mutations in PTEN.,"LESSONS LEARNED: This is the first human interventional study in patients with Cowden syndrome that is driven by inactivation of germline PTEN gene.Single-agent sirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, suppressed mTOR signaling in surrogate human tissues without significant toxicity. BACKGROUND: Cowden syndrome is characterized by inactivating germline PTEN mutations, which can lead to activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. METHODS: Adult subjects with germline PTEN mutation who met international diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome and who had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 and adequate organ function were enrolled. Subjects were treated with a 56-day course of daily oral sirolimus. In addition to symptom assessment and physical examination, dermatologic, endoscopic, neurologic (cerebellar), and radiographic assessments were conducted. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway in benign skin and gastrointestinal (GI) lesion was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients and 16 families were enrolled. PTEN mutations were located at exons 1-8. Regression of skin and GI lesions was observed by dermoscopy or endoscopy. Neurological evaluation showed improvement in cerebellar function score at 1 month. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis in skin and GI benign lesions showed a decrease in the ratio of phosphorylated (p)S6 to total S6 in response to sirolimus. Ratios of pS6K to total S6 at days 14 and 56 were significantly lower than at baseline (p = .0026, p = .00391, respectively). A 56-day course of sirolimus was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: A 56-day course of sirolimus was well tolerated in subjects with Cowden syndrome and was associated with some evidence of improvement in symptoms, skin and GI lesions, cerebellar function, and decreased mTOR signaling.",31350329.txt,0
24795088,High-quality DNA from fingernails for genetic analysis.,"The availability of high-quality germline DNA is an important prerequisite for a variety of genetic analyses. We have shown previously that fingernail clippings provide an optimal source of autologous, constitutional DNA for PCR-based applications. However, most existing protocols for nucleic acid purification from nails do not provide sufficiently high yields of pure and intact DNA for more demanding downstream analyses such as next generation sequencing (NGS). We have extensively tested and systematically modified a number of different protocols for DNA purification from nail material to optimize the yield and quality. The integrity of DNA was determined by PCR amplification of short (<300 bp), mid-range (>400 bp), and long-range (>2 kb) sequences using different target genes. Among the methods tested, the Prepfiler Forensic DNA Extraction kit was identified as the most appropriate approach to isolation of high-quality DNA from nail clippings. A standardized input of 20 mg nail material (1 to 10 pieces of fingernail clippings) yielded a mean of 1 mug DNA (range, 0.5 to 2.3 mug). Subsequent PCR-analysis revealed efficient amplifiability of short and mid-range targets in 93% and 90%, and long-range fragments in 60% of the samples tested. The adequacy for next generation sequencing applications was demonstrated by successful high-resolution HLA-typing in ten transplant recipients. Hence, the protocol presented facilitates the exploitation of fingernail material even for demanding genomic analyses both in research and diagnostics.",24795088.txt,0
31602213,Detection of ctDNA in the plasma of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.,"A total of 15-30% of thyroid nodules that are evaluated by fine-needle aspiration are not clearly determined to be benign or malignant. Gene mutation analysis is recommended for the evaluation of thyroid nodules using clinical guidelines. The detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to aid in the screening, diagnosis and prediction of thyroid cancer prognosis, and can be used when tissues are difficult to obtain. In the present study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on tumors and matched normal tissues from 10 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in Quanzhou, China. Hotspot mutations in tumor DNA and cell-free DNA were identified in the validation cohort, which included 59 patients with PTC. BRAF V600E occurred in five samples, and was the most frequent mutation observed. Variation allele frequency (VAF) of BRAF V600E detected by WES was positively correlated with VAF determined using digital PCR (R2=0.9197; P=0.0099). A number of novel mutated genes were identified, including zinc finger protein 717, pleckstrin homology like domain family A member 1, RBMX like 3, lysine methyltransferase 5A and trichohyalin, along with the reported genes BRAF, NRAS and mucin 16, cell surface associated. Somatic mutated genes were enriched in the 'focal adhesion' pathway, as determined by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes or Gene Ontology analysis. In the validation cohort, 44.07% of tumors were BRAF V600E-positive, and the sensitivity and specificity of BRAF V600E ctDNA were 61.54 and 90.91%, respectively. BRAF V600E was associated with aggressive tumor factors, including lymph node metastasis (P=0.001) and advanced disease stage (P=0.009). The present study investigated the accuracy of ctDNA detection in patients with PTC, and provided evidence that ctDNA can be used as an evaluation of tumor DNA in thyroid nodules.",31602213.txt,1
31152596,The role of gene fusions in melanocytic neoplasms.,"Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed for efficient whole transcriptome sequencing, leading to the identification of important kinase fusions as the primary driver in some melanocytic neoplasms. These fusions typically occur mutually exclusively of one another and other well-known initiating mutations such as BRAF, NRAS, NF1, KIT, and GNAQ. Fusions are found in over 50% of Spitz neoplasms, including ALK, BRAF, NTRK1, NTRK3, ROS1, MET, MAP3K8, and RET. Familiarity with the typical morphologic features of certain fusion-driven melanocytic neoplasms can help with classification, diagnosis, and identification of targeted molecular therapies in malignant cases. Spitz tumors with ALK, NTRK1, and NTRK3 fusions have characteristic morphologic features. BRAF and MAP3K8 fusions, in particular, tend to be epithelioid, high grade, and more frequent in Spitz melanoma than other fusion subtypes. Sporadic cases of pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma may have PRKCA fusions and sheets of monomorphic epithelioid melanocytes. Fusion events are also enriched among melanomas without the key mutations BRAF, NRAS, or NF1. Although NGS is the most reliable method to detect fusions, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization are cost-effective alternatives in some cases. We describe recent discoveries regarding the role of kinase fusions in melanocytic neoplasms and their associated morphologies.",31152596.txt,1
30778901,Disruption of Spermatogenesis and Infertility in Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia Type 2 (AOA2).,"Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) is a rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia characterized by onset between 10 and 20 years of age and a range of neurological features that include progressive cerebellar atrophy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, oculomotor apraxia in a majority of patients, and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). AOA2 is caused by mutation of the SETX gene which encodes senataxin, a DNA/RNA helicase involved in transcription regulation, RNA processing, and DNA maintenance. Disruption of senataxin in rodents led to defective spermatogenesis and sterility in males uncovering a key role for senataxin in male germ cell survival. Here, we report the first clinical and cellular evidence of impaired spermatogenesis in AOA2 patients. We assessed sperm production in three AOA2 patients and testicular pathology in one patient and compared the findings to those of Setx-knockout mice. Sperm production was impaired in all patients assessed (3/3, 100%). Analyses of testicular biopsies from an AOA2 patient recapitulate features of the histology seen in Setx-knockout mice, strongly suggesting an underlying mechanism centering on DNA-damage-mediated germ cell apoptosis. These findings support a role for senataxin in human reproductive function and highlight a novel clinical feature of AOA2 that extends the extra-neurological roles of senataxin. This raises an important reproductive counseling issue for clinicians, and fertility specialists should be aware of SETX mutations as a possible diagnosis in young male patients presenting with oligospermia or azoospermia since infertility may presage the later onset of neurological manifestations in some individuals.",30778901.txt,0
31005870,Hereditary segmental neurofibromatosis: a report of three cases in a family.,"Hereditary segmental neurofibromatosis (SNF) is an extremely rare form of SNF with nine families reported till date. SNF is considered to be a result of mosaicism and hereditary transmission is possibly explained by increased susceptibility of mutations at neurofibromatosis gene loci. We report here three members of an Indian family with SNF. Our index case, a 20-year-old woman had multiple soft to firm papules and nodules over right shoulder associated with severe intermittent pain. Her father had three similar nodules over left upper arm and elder sister had two such nodules over right upper arm. The father and elder sister were incidentally diagnosed and they had never sought medical advice considering their lesions to be a familial trait. In the absence of symptoms, many familial cases of SNF are missed thus making any systematic analysis to ascertain its genetic basis difficult.",31005870.txt,0
27255792,MutSbeta promotes trinucleotide repeat expansion by recruiting DNA polymerase beta to nascent (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins for error-prone DNA synthesis.,"Expansion of (CAG) (CTG) repeats causes a number of familial neurodegenerative disorders. Although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, components involved in DNA mismatch repair, particularly mismatch recognition protein MutSbeta (a MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), are implicated in (CAG) (CTG) repeat expansion. In addition to recognizing small insertion-deletion loop-outs, MutSbeta also specifically binds DNA hairpin imperfect heteroduplexes formed within (CAG)n (CTG)n sequences. However, whether or not and how MutSbeta binding triggers expansion of (CAG) (CTG) repeats remain unknown. We show here that purified recombinant MutSbeta physically interacts with DNA polymerase beta (Polbeta) and stimulates Polbeta-catalyzed (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpin retention. Consistent with these in vitro observations, MutSbeta and Polbeta interact with each other in vivo, and colocalize at (CAG) (CTG) repeats during DNA replication. Our data support a model for error-prone processing of (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins by MutSbeta and Polbeta during DNA replication and/or repair: MutSbeta recognizes (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins formed in the nascent DNA strand, and recruits Polbeta to the complex, which then utilizes the hairpin as a primer for extension, leading to (CAG) (CTG) repeat expansion. This study provides a novel mechanism for trinucleotide repeat expansion in both dividing and non-dividing cells.",27255792.txt,0
31421692,Current state of biomarkers for the diagnosis and assessment of treatment efficacy of prostate cancer.,"In recent years, with the westernization of lifestyle, reduced physical activity and increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, the incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) has risen significantly in developing countries. Currently, PSA is the only PCa biomarker applied clinically, but it does not perform well in the early diagnosis and distinguishing between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. With the advances in deep sequencing technology, a series of new PCa biomarkers have been recently proposed to improve the diagnostic value of PSA, such as prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), TMPRSS2-ETS fusion gene, microRNA, and other regulatory non-coding RNAs. In addition, the prostate health index (PHI) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in the detection of PCa. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been confirmed to be specifically expressed on the surface of PCa cells. In this review, we provide an updated summary of the value and features of these novel biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.",31421692.txt,1
37322115,Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with protection from Alzheimer's disease.,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a premalignant expansion of mutated hematopoietic stem cells. As CHIP-associated mutations are known to alter the development and function of myeloid cells, we hypothesized that CHIP may also be associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disease in which brain-resident myeloid cells are thought to have a major role. To perform association tests between CHIP and AD dementia, we analyzed blood DNA sequencing data from 1,362 individuals with AD and 4,368 individuals without AD. Individuals with CHIP had a lower risk of AD dementia (meta-analysis odds ratio (OR) = 0.64, P = 3.8 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), and Mendelian randomization analyses supported a potential causal association. We observed that the same mutations found in blood were also detected in microglia-enriched fraction of the brain in seven of eight CHIP carriers. Single-nucleus chromatin accessibility profiling of brain-derived nuclei in six CHIP carriers revealed that the mutated cells comprised a large proportion of the microglial pool in the samples examined. While additional studies are required to validate the mechanistic findings, these results suggest that CHIP may have a role in attenuating the risk of AD.",37322115.txt,0
31316083,SREBP1-dependent de novo fatty acid synthesis gene expression is elevated in malignant melanoma and represents a cellular survival trait.,"de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (DNFA) is a hallmark adaptation of many cancers that supports survival, proliferation, and metastasis. Here we elucidate previously unexplored aspects of transcription regulation and clinical relevance of DNFA in cancers. We show that elevated expression of DNFA genes is characteristic of many tumor types and correlates with poor prognosis, especially in melanomas. Elevated DNFA gene expression depends on the SREBP1 transcription factor in multiple melanoma cell lines. SREBP1 predominantly binds to the transcription start sites of DNFA genes, regulating their expression by recruiting RNA polymerase II to promoters for productive transcription elongation. We find that SREBP1-regulated DNFA represents a survival trait in melanoma cells, regardless of proliferative state and oncogenic mutation status. Indeed, malignant melanoma cells exhibit elevated DNFA gene expression after the BRAF/MEK signaling pathway is blocked (e.g. by BRAF inhibitors), and DNFA expression remains higher in melanoma cells resistant to vemurafenib treatment than in untreated cells. Accordingly, DNFA pathway inhibition, whether by direct targeting of SREBP1 with antisense oligonucleotides, or through combinatorial effects of multiple DNFA enzyme inhibitors, exerts potent cytotoxic effects on both BRAFi-sensitive and -resistant melanoma cells. Altogether, these results implicate SREBP1 and DNFA enzymes as enticing therapeutic targets in melanomas.",31316083.txt,1
29196283,Ringed telangiectasias: an unusual presentation of telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans.,"Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP) is a rare form of cutaneous mastocytosis. While most cutaneous mastocytoses occur in children and are asymptomatic, TMEP occurs predominantly in adults and is associated with systemic manifestations, requiring medical management. TMEP is typically characterised by scattered red-brown macules on the trunk and extremities, but must be differentiated from other telangiectatic conditions such as scleroderma, hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and telangiectasias secondary to cirrhosis. Practitioners must be aware that variants to the classic presentation of TMEP exist, such as the ringed telangiectasias we describe. Diagnostic workup including tissue biopsy must be considered in such patients after a thorough history and physical have been performed and other telangiectatic processes have been ruled out. The treatment of cutaneous mastocytosis aims at controlling symptoms and preventing mast cell degranulation. Cosmetic treatment includes the use ofPsoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, total skin electron beam radiation and flashlamp pulsed-dye laser treatment.",29196283.txt,0
29775646,The RNA binding protein Ars2 supports hematopoiesis at multiple levels.,"Recent biochemical characterization of arsenic resistance protein 2 (Ars2) has established it as central in determining the fate of nascent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase II (RNAPII) transcripts. Through interactions with the nuclear 5'-7-methylguanosine cap-binding complex, Ars2 promotes cotranscriptional processing coupled with nuclear export or degradation of several classes of RNAPII transcripts, allowing for gene expression programs that facilitate rapid and sustained proliferation of immortalized cells in culture. However, rapidly dividing cells in culture do not represent the physiological condition of the vast majority of cells in an adult mammal. To examine functions of Ars2 in a physiological setting, we generated inducible Ars2 knockout mice and found that deletion of Ars2 from adult mice resulted in defective hematopoiesis in bone marrow and thymus. Importantly, only some of this defect could be explained by the requirement of Ars2 for rapid proliferation, which we found to be cell-type specific in vivo. Rather, Ars2 was required for survival of developing thymocytes and for limiting differentiation of bone marrow resident long-term hematopoietic stem cells. As a result, Ars2 knockout led to rapid thymic involution and loss of the ability of mice to regenerate peripheral blood after myeloablation. These in vivo data demonstrate that Ars2 expression is important at several steps of hematopoiesis, likely because Ars2 acts on gene expression programs underlying essential cell fate decisions such as the decision to die,proliferate, or differentiate.",29775646.txt,0
24789688,Fifty-four novel mutations in the NF1 gene and integrated analyses of the mutations that modulate splicing.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. One of the hallmarks of NF1 is the high mutation rate in this gene. In this study, we present 127 different NF1 mutations and 54 novel mutations detected at both the genomic DNA and mRNA level using a retrospective case series review. We found that 25.2% of these different mutations induced aberrant splicing. Of note, 40.6% of these splicing errors were caused by exonic variants. In addition, one mutation produced mosaicism in the post-transcriptional profile. However, studies investigating these splicing aberrations are limited. In order to better understand the pathogenicity of NF1 and to provide a more accurate interpretation in molecular diagnostic testing, combined computational analyses were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the variants modulating NF1 gene splicing.",24789688.txt,0
24806963,Peptide-independent stabilization of MHC class I molecules breaches cellular quality control.,"The intracellular trafficking of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) proteins is directed by three quality control mechanisms that test for their structural integrity, which is correlated to the binding of high-affinity antigenic peptide ligands. To investigate which molecular features of MHC-I these quality control mechanisms detect, we have followed the hypothesis that suboptimally loaded MHC-I molecules are characterized by their conformational mobility in the F-pocket region of the peptide-binding site. We have created a novel variant of an MHC-I protein, K(b)-Y84C, in which two alpha-helices in this region are linked by a disulfide bond that mimics the conformational and dynamic effects of bound high-affinity peptide. K(b)-Y84C shows a remarkable increase in the binding affinity to its light chain, beta-2 microglobulin (beta2m), and bypasses all three cellular quality control steps. Our data demonstrate (1) that coupling between peptide and beta2m binding to the MHC-I heavy chain is mediated by conformational dynamics; (2) that the folded conformation of MHC-I, supported by beta2m, plays a decisive role in passing the ER-to-cell-surface transport quality controls; and (3) that beta2m association is also tested by the cell surface quality control that leads to MHC-I endocytosis.",24806963.txt,0
24475179,Plakophilin-3 catenin associates with the ETV1/ER81 transcription factor to positively modulate gene activity.,"Members of the plakophilin-catenin sub-family (Pkp-1, -2, and -3) facilitate the linkage of desmosome junctional components to each other (e.g. desmosomal cadherins to desmoplakin) and the intermediate-filament cytoskeleton. Pkps also contribute to desmosomal stabilization and the trafficking of its components. The functions of Pkps outside of the desmosome are less well studied, despite evidence suggesting their roles in mRNA regulation, small-GTPase modulation (e.g. mid-body scission) during cell division, and cell survival following DNA damage. Pkp-catenins are further believed to have roles in the nucleus given their nuclear localization in some contexts and the known nuclear roles of structurally related catenins, such as beta-catenin and p120-catenin. Further, Pkp-catenin activities in the nuclear compartment have become of increased interest with the identification of interactions between Pkp2-catenin and RNA Pol III and Pkp1 with single-stranded DNA. Consistent with earlier reports suggesting possible nuclear roles in development, we previously demonstrated prominent nuclear localization of Pkp3 in Xenopus naive ectoderm (""animal cap"") cells and recently resolved a similar localization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Here, we report the association and positive functional interaction of Pkp3 with a transcription factor, Ets variant gene 1 (ETV1), which has critical roles in neural development and prominent roles in human genetic disease. Our results are the first to report the interaction of a sequence-specific transcription factor with any Pkp. Using Xenopus laevis embryos and mammalian cells, we provide evidence for the Pkp3:ETV1 complex on both biochemical and functional levels.",24475179.txt,0
24815379,Application of COLD-PCR for improved detection of NF2 mosaic mutations.,"Somatic mosaicism represents the coexistence of two or more cell populations with different genotypes in one person, and it is involved in >30 monogenic disorders. Somatic mosaicism characterizes approximately 25% to 33% of patients with de novo neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The identification of mosaicism is crucial to patients and their families because the clinical course of the disease and its transmission risk is influenced by the degree and distribution of mutated cells. Moreover, in NF2, the capability of discriminating patients with mosaicism is especially important to make differential diagnosis with schwannomatosis. However, the identification of mosaic variants is considerably difficult, and the development of specific molecular techniques to detect low levels of unknown molecular alterations is required. Co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature (COLD)-PCR has been described as a powerful method to selectively amplify minority alleles from mixtures of wild-type and mutation-containing sequences. Here, we applied COLD-PCR to molecular analysis of patients with NF2 mosaicism. With the use of COLD-PCR, followed by direct sequencing, we were able to detect NF2 mutations in blood DNA of three patients with NF2 mosaicism. Our study has shown the capability of COLD-PCR in enriching low-represented mutated allele in blood DNA sample, making it usable for molecular diagnosis of patients with mosaicism.",24815379.txt,0

Personalised Anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease (PANTS) is a UK-wide, multicentre, prospective observational cohort study reporting the rates of effectiveness of infliximab and adalimumab in anti-TNF-naive patients with active luminal Crohn's disease aged 6 years and older. At the end of the first year, sites were invited to enrol participants still receiving study drug into the 2-year PANTS-extension study. We estimated rates of remission across the whole cohort at the end of years 1, 2, and 3 of the study using a modified survival technique with permutation testing. Multivariable regression and survival analyses were used to identify factors associated with loss of response in patients who had initially responded to anti-TNF therapy and with immunogenicity. Loss of response was defined in patients who initially responded to anti-TNF therapy at the end of induction and who subsequently developed symptomatic activity that warranted an escalation of steroid, immunomodulatory, or anti-TNF therapy, resectional surgery, or exit from study due to treatment failure. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03088449, and is now complete.
Between March 19, 2014, and Sept 21, 2017, 389 (41%) of 955 patients treated with infliximab and 209 (32%) of 655 treated with adalimumab in the PANTS study entered the PANTS-extension study (median age 32·5 years [IQR 22·1-46·8], 307 [51%] of 598 were female, and 291 [49%] were male). The estimated proportion of patients in remission at the end of years 1, 2, and 3 were, for infliximab 40·2% (95% CI 36·7-43·7), 34·4% (29·9-39·0), and 34·7% (29·8-39·5), and for adalimumab 35·9% (95% CI 31·2-40·5), 32·9% (26·8-39·2), and 28·9% (21·9-36·3), respectively. Optimal drug concentrations at week 14 to predict remission at any later timepoints were 6·1-10·0 mg/L for infliximab and 10·1-12·0 mg/L for adalimumab. After excluding patients who had primary non-response, the estimated proportions of patients who had loss of response by years 1, 2, and 3 were, for infliximab 34·4% (95% CI 30·4-38·2), 54·5% (49·4-59·0), and 60·0% (54·1-65·2), and for adalimumab 32·1% (26·7-37·1), 47·2% (40·2-53·4), and 68·4% (50·9-79·7), respectively. In multivariable analysis, loss of response at year 2 and 3 for patients treated with infliximab and adalimumab was predicted by low anti-TNF drug concentrations at week 14 (infliximab: hazard ratio [HR] for each ten-fold increase in drug concentration 0·45 [95% CI 0·30-0·67], adalimumab: 0·39 [0·22-0·70]). For patients treated with infliximab, loss of response was also associated with female sex (vs male sex; HR 1·47 [95% CI 1·11-1·95]), obesity (vs not obese 1·62 [1·08-2·42]), baseline white cell count (1·06 [1·02-1·11) per 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> increase in cells per L), and thiopurine dose quartile. Among patients treated with adalimumab, carriage of the HLA-DQA1*05 risk variant was associated with loss of response (HR 1·95 [95% CI 1·17-3·25]). By the end of year 3, the estimated proportion of patients who developed anti-drug antibodies associated with undetectable drug concentrations was 44·0% (95% CI 38·1-49·4) among patients treated with infliximab and 20·3% (13·8-26·2) among those treated with adalimumab. The development of anti-drug antibodies associated with undetectable drug concentrations was significantly associated with treatment without concomitant immunomodulator use for both groups (HR for immunomodulator use: infliximab 0·40 [95% CI 0·31-0·52], adalimumab 0·42 [95% CI 0·24-0·75]), and with carriage of HLA-DQA1*05 risk variant for infliximab (HR for carriage of risk variant: infliximab 1·46 [1·13-1·88]) but not for adalimumab (HR 1·60 [0·92-2·77]). Concomitant use of an immunomodulator before or on the day of starting infliximab was associated with increased time without the development of anti-drug antibodies associated with undetectable drug concentrations compared with use of infliximab alone (HR 2·87 [95% CI 2·20-3·74]) or introduction of an immunomodulator after anti-TNF initiation (1·70 [1·11-2·59]). In years 2 and 3, 16 (4%) of 389 patients treated with infliximab and 11 (5%) of 209 treated with adalimumab had adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal. Nine (2%) patients treated with infliximab and two (1%) of those treated with adalimumab had serious infections in years 2 and 3.
Only around a third of patients with active luminal Crohn's disease treated with an anti-TNF drug were in remission at the end of 3 years of treatment. Low drug concentrations at the end of the induction period predict loss of response by year 3 of treatment, suggesting higher drug concentrations during the first year of treatment, particularly during induction, might lead to better long-term outcomes. Anti-drug antibodies associated with undetectable drug concentrations of infliximab, but not adalimumab, can be predicted by carriage of HLA-DQA1*05 and mitigated by concomitant immunomodulator use for both drugs.

33372216,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Choroid Plexus Tumors: A Report of the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation.,"Choroid plexus tumors (CPT) are rare epithelial tumors of the choroid plexus. Gross total resection (GTR) may be curative, but it is not always possible.
To evaluate the role of Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSRS) as either a primary or adjuvant management option for WHO grade I-III CPT through a multicenter project.
A total of 32 patients (20 females) with a total of 43 treated tumors were included in the analysis. A total of 25 patients (78%) had undergone initial surgical resection. The median total tumor volume was 2.2 cc, and the median margin and maximum doses were 13 and 25.5 Gy, respectively.
Local tumor control was achieved in 69% of cases. Local tumor progression-free survival (PFS) rate for low-grade tumors at 1, 3, and 5 yr was 90%, 77%, 58%, respectively. The actuarial local tumor PFS rate for high-grade tumors at 1, 3, and 5 yr was 77%, 62%, and 62%, respectively. There was no significant difference in local tumor control rates between low- and high-grade CPT (P = .3). Gender, age, and degree of resection were not associated with treated tumor PFS. Distant intracranial spread developed in 6 patients at a median of 22 mo after initial SRS. Actuarial distant brain tumor PFS rate at 1, 2, 5, and 10 yr was 93%, 88%, 78%, and 65%, respectively. Three patients (9%) developed persistent symptomatic adverse radiation effects at a median of 11 mo after the procedure.
GKSRS represents a minimally invasive alternative management strategy for imaging defined or surgically recurrent low- and high-grade CPT.",33372216.txt,1
26942200,Mechanical and Histological Effects of Resorbable Blasting Media Surface Treatment on the Initial Stability of Orthodontic Mini-Implants.,"Introduction. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resorbable blasting media (RBM) treatment on early stability of orthodontic mini-implants by mechanical, histomorphometric, and histological analyses. Methods. Ninety-six (64 for mechanical study and 32 for histological study and histomorphometric analysis) titanium orthodontic mini-implants (OMIs) with machined (machined group) or RBM-treated (CaP) surface (RBM group) were implanted in the tibiae of 24 rabbits. Maximum initial torque (MIT) was measured during insertion, and maximum removal torque (MRT) and removal angular momentum (RAM) were measured at 2 and 4 weeks after implantation. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone area (BA) were analyzed at 4 weeks after implantation. Results. RBM group exhibited significantly lower MIT and significantly higher MRT and RAM at 2 weeks than machined group. No significant difference in MRT, RAM, and BIC between the two groups was noted at 4 weeks, although BA was significantly higher in RBM group than in machined group. RBM group showed little bone resorption, whereas machined group showed new bone formation after bone resorption. Conclusions. RBM surface treatment can provide early stability of OMIs around 2 weeks after insertion, whereas stability of machined surface OMIs may decrease in early stages because of bone resorption, although it can subsequently recover by new bone apposition.",26942200.txt,0
25659728,Mutational profiling in patients with MDS: ready for every-day use in the clinic?,"Multiple recurrent somatic mutations were identified in the majority of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but investigating the broad spectrum of molecular markers in MDS exceeds many laboratories' capacity when traditional molecular techniques are used. High-throughput second generation sequencing (=next-generation sequencing, NGS) has proven to be applicable for comprehensive biomarker mutation analyses allowing to increase diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy and to improve risk stratification and prognostication in addition to cytomorphology and cytogenetic analysis in patients with MDS. Amplicon deep-sequencing enables comprehensive biomarker analysis in a multitude of patients per investigation in an acceptable turn-around time and at affordable costs. Comprehensive myeloid marker panels were successfully introduced into diagnostic practice. Therefore, molecular mutation analysis is ready for use in all patients with suspected MDS, may contribute to risk stratification in possible candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and should become an integral part of clinical research studies in MDS patients.",25659728.txt,0
29133782,mTOR intersects antibody-inducing signals from TACI in marginal zone B cells.,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) enhances immunity in addition to orchestrating metabolism. Here we show that mTOR coordinates immunometabolic reconfiguration of marginal zone (MZ) B cells, a pre-activated lymphocyte subset that mounts antibody responses to T-cell-independent antigens through a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-amplified pathway involving transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI). This receptor interacts with mTOR via the TLR adapter MyD88. The resulting mTOR activation instigates MZ B-cell proliferation, immunoglobulin G (IgG) class switching, and plasmablast differentiation through a rapamycin-sensitive pathway that integrates metabolic and antibody-inducing transcription programs, including NF-kappaB. Disruption of TACI-mTOR interaction by rapamycin, truncation of the MyD88-binding domain of TACI, or B-cell-conditional mTOR deficiency interrupts TACI signaling via NF-kappaB and cooperation with TLRs, thereby hampering IgG production to T-cell-independent antigens but not B-cell survival. Thus, mTOR drives innate-like antibody responses by linking proximal TACI signaling events with distal immunometabolic transcription programs.",29133782.txt,0
26460258,An unusual long-term outcome of a child with primary myelofibrosis harboring a JAK2 mutation.,"We report an extremely rare case of a female child who presented the onset of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) harboring JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2 gene) mutation (JAK2V617F) when she was 15 months old. She was monitored over 25 years, a period in which she was treated with spleen radiotherapy and recombinant interferon alpha. She also underwent splenectomy when she was 13 years old, due to massive splenomegaly, anemia and various infection disease episodes. The longstanding evolution of the patient enabled us to verify that there were no complications related to post-splenectomy events and/or blast transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe PMF with JAK2 mutation in a child. We provide evidence that a better quality of life and long survival in pediatric PMF may be provided by splenectomy.",26460258.txt,0
26622064,KIT D816V-mutated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in indolent systemic mastocytosis are associated with disease progression.,"Multilineage involvement of bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis by the somatic KIT D816V mutation is present in a subset of adult indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) patients in association with a poorer prognosis. Here, we investigated the potential involvement of BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from ISM patients by the KIT D816V mutation and its potential impact on disease progression and outcome. This mutation was investigated in highly purified BM MSCs and other BM cell populations from 83 ISM patients followed for a median of 116 months. KIT D816V-mutated MSCs were detected in 22 of 83 cases. All MSC-mutated patients had multilineage KIT mutation (100% vs 30%, P = .0001) and they more frequently showed involvement of lymphoid plus myeloid BM cells (59% vs 22%; P = .03) and a polyclonal pattern of inactivation of the X-chromosome of KIT-mutated BM mast cells (64% vs 0%; P = .01) vs other multilineage ISM cases. Moreover, presence of KIT-mutated MSCs was associated with more advanced disease features, a greater rate of disease progression (50% vs 17%; P = .04), and a shorter progression-free survival (P <= .003). Overall, these results support the notion that ISM patients with mutated MSCs may have acquired the KIT mutation in a common pluripotent progenitor cell, prior to differentiation into MSCs and hematopoietic precursor cells, before the X-chromosome inactivation process occurs. From a clinical point of view, acquisition of the KIT mutation in an earlier BM precursor cell confers a significantly greater risk for disease progression and a poorer outcome.",26622064.txt,0
28679735,Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 29 patients hemizygous for hypomorphic IKBKG/NEMO mutations.,"X-linked recessive ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency is a rare primary immunodeficiency caused by hypomorphic mutations of the IKBKG gene encoding the nuclear factor kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) protein. This condition displays enormous allelic, immunological, and clinical heterogeneity, and therapeutic decisions are difficult because NEMO operates in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is potentially life-saving, but the small number of case reports available suggests it has been reserved for only the most severe cases. Here, we report the health status before HSCT, transplantation outcome, and clinical follow-up for a series of 29 patients from unrelated kindreds from 11 countries. Between them, these patients carry 23 different hypomorphic IKBKG mutations. HSCT was performed from HLA-identical related donors (n = 7), HLA-matched unrelated donors (n = 12), HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (n = 8), and HLA-haploidentical related donors (n = 2). Engraftment was documented in 24 patients, and graft-versus-host disease in 13 patients. Up to 7 patients died 0.2 to 12 months after HSCT. The global survival rate after HSCT among NEMO-deficient children was 74% at a median follow-up after HSCT of 57 months (range, 4-108 months). Preexisting mycobacterial infection and colitis were associated with poor HSCT outcome. The underlying mutation does not appear to have any influence, as patients with the same mutation had different outcomes. Transplantation did not appear to cure colitis, possibly as a result of cell-intrinsic disorders of the epithelial barrier. Overall, HSCT can cure most clinical features of patients with a variety of IKBKG mutations.",28679735.txt,0
25441388,Differentiating skin-limited and multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify features associated with multisystem involvement and therapeutic failure in patients with skin Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed medical records of 71 consecutive patients with LCH with skin involvement evaluated at Texas Children's Hospital and analyzed clinical features, laboratory results, and the presence of circulating cells with the BRAF-V600E mutation with respect to initial staging and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Skin disease in patients older than 18 months of age at diagnosis was associated with the presence of multisystem disease (OR, 9.65; 95% CI, 1.17-79.4). Forty percent of patients referred for presumed skin-limited LCH had underlying multisystem involvement, one-half of these with risk-organ involvement. Patients with skin-limited LCH had a 3-year progression-free survival of 89% after initial therapy, and none developed multisystem disease. Patients with skin/multisystem involvement had a 3-year progression-free survival of 44% with vinblastine/prednisone therapy, and risk-organ involvement did not correlate with failure to achieve nonactive disease. Circulating cells with BRAF-V600E were detected at higher frequency in patients with multisystem involvement (8 of 11 skin/multisystem vs 1 of 13 skin-limited; P = .002). CONCLUSION: Skin-limited LCH necessitates infrequent therapeutic intervention and has a lower risk of progression relative to skin plus multisystem LCH. The less-aggressive clinical course and lack of circulating cells with the BRAF-V600E mutation in skin-limited LCH suggest a different mechanism of disease origin compared with multisystem or risk-organ disease.",25441388.txt,0
30639322,ZMIZ1 Variants Cause a Syndromic Neurodevelopmental Disorder.,"ZMIZ1 is a coactivator of several transcription factors, including p53, the androgen receptor, and NOTCH1. Here, we report 19 subjects with intellectual disability and developmental delay carrying variants in ZMIZ1. The associated features include growth failure, feeding difficulties, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and various other congenital malformations. Of these 19, 14 unrelated subjects carried de novo heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or single-base insertions/deletions, 3 siblings harbored a heterozygous single-base insertion, and 2 subjects had a balanced translocation disrupting ZMIZ1 or involving a regulatory region of ZMIZ1. In total, we identified 13 point mutations that affect key protein regions, including a SUMO acceptor site, a central disordered alanine-rich motif, a proline-rich domain, and a transactivation domain. All identified variants were absent from all available exome and genome databases. In vitro, ZMIZ1 showed impaired coactivation of the androgen receptor. In vivo, overexpression of ZMIZ1 mutant alleles in developing mouse brains using in utero electroporation resulted in abnormal pyramidal neuron morphology, polarization, and positioning, underscoring the importance of ZMIZ1 in neural development and supporting mutations in ZMIZ1 as the cause of a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome.",30639322.txt,0
31100224,Features and Prognostic Significance of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.,"CONTEXT: Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is an intraglandular/ductal neoplastic growth of glandular epithelial cells characterized by marked abnormality of the glandular architecture and/or cytological atypia that exceeds what is typically seen in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HPGIN). It has been shown that IDC-P is a strong independent indicator of poor prognosis for prostate carcinoma (PCa). OBJECTIVE: To review the pathological and genetic features, diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis, and clinical significance of IDC-P. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed was searched using keywords including prostate carcinoma, intraductal carcinoma, IDC, histology, diagnostic criteria, and prognosis. The references in relevant articles were also reviewed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: IDC-P is a distinct entity with characteristic morphological and genetic features. It is strongly associated with aggressive PCa with high Gleason score/grade groups and large tumor volume, and portends unfavorable clinical outcomes. Morphological diagnostic criteria have been established to distinguish it from other lesions with similar histological features. IDC-P is an uncommon finding in prostate biopsies, and is even rarer as an isolated finding without concomitant PCa. However, patients with isolated IDC-P in biopsy specimens are recommended to have either definitive treatment or immediate repeat biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: It is critical to recognize and report IDC-P, especially in prostate biopsies, where the clinical impact of such a diagnosis is greatest. PATIENT SUMMARY: Intraductal carcinoma is a unique form of aggressive prostate cancer. In this report, we review its pathological and genetic features and poor prognostic significance. It is critical for pathologists to recognize and report this lesion in prostate specimens, especially in prostate biopsies for patient management.",31100224.txt,1
31297240,Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in patients with oncogene- addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): summary of a multidisciplinary round-table discussion.,"The introduction of targeted treatments and more recently immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) to the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has dramatically changed the prognosis of selected patients. For patients with oncogene-addicted metastatic NSCLC harbouring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) mutation or an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) gene alteration (translocation, fusion, amplification) mutation-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are already first-line standard treatment, while targeted treatment for other driver mutations affecting MET, RET, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2, tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK) 1-3 and others are currently under investigation. The role of ICI in these patient subgroups is currently under debate. This article summarises a round-table discussion organised by ESMO Open in Vienna in July 2018. It reviews current clinical data on ICI treatment in patients with metastatic oncogene-addicted NSCLC and discusses molecular diagnostic assessment, potential biomarkers and radiological methods for response evaluation of ICI treatment. The round-table panel concluded ICI should only be considered in patients with oncogene-addicted NSCLC after exhaustion of effective targeted therapies and in some cases possibly after all other therapies including chemotherapies. More clinical trials on combination therapies and biomarkers for ICI therapy based on the specific differing characteristics of oncogene-addicted NSCLC need to be conducted.",31297240.txt,1
25600436,Identification of chimeric antigen receptors that mediate constitutive or inducible proliferation of T cells.,"This study compared second-generation chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) encoding signaling domains composed of CD28, ICOS, and 4-1BB (TNFRSF9). Here, we report that certain CARs endow T cells with the ability to undergo long-term autonomous proliferation. Transduction of primary human T cells with lentiviral vectors encoding some of the CARs resulted in sustained proliferation for up to 3 months following a single stimulation through the T-cell receptor (TCR). Sustained numeric expansion was independent of cognate antigen and did not require the addition of exogenous cytokines or feeder cells after a single stimulation of the TCR and CD28. Results from gene array and functional assays linked sustained cytokine secretion and expression of T-bet (TBX21), EOMES, and GATA-3 to the effect. Sustained expression of the endogenous IL2 locus has not been reported in primary T cells. Sustained proliferation was dependent on CAR structure and high expression, the latter of which was necessary but not sufficient. The mechanism involves constitutive signaling through NF-kappaB, AKT, ERK, and NFAT. The propagated CAR T cells retained a diverse TCR repertoire, and cellular transformation was not observed. The CARs with a constitutive growth phenotype displayed inferior antitumor effects and engraftment in vivo. Therefore, the design of CARs that have a nonconstitutive growth phenotype may be a strategy to improve efficacy and engraftment of CAR T cells. The identification of CARs that confer constitutive or nonconstitutive growth patterns may explain observations that CAR T cells have differential survival patterns in clinical trials.",25600436.txt,0
38052076,Discriminative fusion of moments-aligned latent representation of multimodality medical data.,"Fusion of multimodal medical data provides multifaceted, disease-relevant information for diagnosis or prognosis prediction modeling. Traditional fusion strategies such as feature concatenation often fail to learn hidden complementary and discriminative manifestations from high-dimensional multimodal data. To this end, we proposed a methodology for the integration of multimodality medical data by matching their moments in a latent space, where the hidden, shared information of multimodal data is gradually learned by optimization with multiple feature collinearity and correlation constrains. We first obtained the multimodal hidden representations by learning mappings between the original domain and shared latent space. Within this shared space, we utilized several relational regularizations, including data attribute preservation, feature collinearity and feature-task correlation, to encourage learning of the underlying associations inherent in multimodal data. The fused multimodal latent features were finally fed to a logistic regression classifier for diagnostic prediction. Extensive evaluations on three independent clinical datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in fusing multimodal data for medical prediction modeling.&#xD.",38052076.txt,0
31263451,Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1): An Update and the Significance of Early Genetic and Clinical Diagnosis.,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary tumor syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and characterized by a predisposition to a multitude of endocrine neoplasms primarily of parathyroid, enteropancreatic, and anterior pituitary origin, as well as nonendocrine neoplasms. Other endocrine tumors in MEN1 include foregut carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, and rarely pheochromocytoma. Nonendocrine manifestations include meningiomas and ependymomas, lipomas, angiofibromas, collagenomas, and leiomyomas. MEN1 is caused by inactivating mutations of the tumor suppressor gene MEN1 which encodes the protein menin. This syndrome can affect all age groups, with 17% of patients developing MEN1-associated tumors before 21 years of age. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of MEN1-associated tumors, patients with MEN1 continue to have decreased life expectancy primarily due to malignant neuroendocrine tumors. The most recent clinical practice guidelines for MEN1, published in 2012, highlight the need for early genetic and clinical diagnosis of MEN1 and recommend an intensive surveillance approach for both patients with this syndrome and asymptomatic carriers starting at the age of 5 years with the goal of timely detection and management of MEN1-associated neoplasms and ultimately decreased disease-specific morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation and individual mutation-dependent surveillance is not possible currently.",31263451.txt,1
30009677,Generation of CD34 Fluorescent Reporter Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Monitoring Hematopoietic Differentiation.,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold great promise for disease modeling, drug screens, and eventually cell therapy approaches. During in vitro differentiation of hiPSCs into hematoendothelial progenitors, the emergence of CD34-positive cells indicates a critical step of lineage specification. To facilitate the monitoring of hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs, we established fluorescent reporter cells for the stem and progenitor cell marker CD34. An IRES-GFP (internal ribosome entry site green fluorescent protein) construct was introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 into the 3' untranslated region of one endogenous CD34 allele. Single-cell clones were generated after excision of the floxed puromycin resistance cassette by Cre recombination and correct insertion was confirmed by genotyping polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot. To validate their functionality, the reporter hiPSCs were in vitro differentiated toward CD34+ cells using the STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit combined with short-term inhibition of GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3). All cells expressing nuclear GFP were positive for cell surface CD34, thus allowing the direct monitoring of the differentiation of hiPSCs into CD34+ cells either by flow cytometry or confocal microscopy. After fluorescence-activated cell sorting, cells displaying high GFP expression exhibited increased colony-forming potential in the MethoCult colony-forming unit assays as compared with CD34+ cells obtained by magnetic-activated cell sorting. In summary, we have generated functional CD34 GFP reporter hiPSCs, which not only permit label-free separation of HSPCs, but also tracing of the emergence and fate of CD34+ progenitors at the single-cell level.",30009677.txt,0
37402998,Inhibition of TMEM16A improves cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury via preventing DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our previous study has demonstrated that TMEM16A, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride channel, contributes to renal fibrosis progression in chronic kidney disease. However, whether TMEM16A is involved in AKI is still unknown. In this study, we established cisplatin AKI mice model and found that TMEM16A expression was upregulated in the injured kidney. In vivo knockdown of TMEM16A effectively prevented cisplatin-induced tubular cell apoptosis, inflammation and kidney function loss. Western blot and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that TMEM16A knockdown inhibited Drp1 translocation from the cytoplasm to mitochondria and prevented mitochondrial fission in tubular cells. Consistently, in cultured HK2 cells, knockdown or inhibition of TMEM16A by shRNA or its specific inhibitor suppressed cisplatin-induced mitochondrial fission and its associated energy dysfunction, ROS accumulation, and cell apoptosis via inhibiting Drp1 activation. Further investigation showed that genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of TMEM16A inhibited cisplatin-induced Drp1 Ser-616 site phosphorylation through ERK1/2 signaling pathway, whereas overexpression of TMEM16A promoted this effect. Treatment with Drp1 or ERK1/2 inhibitor could efficiently prevent cisplatin-induced mitochondrial fission. Collectively, our data suggest that TMEM16A inhibition alleviated cisplatin-induced AKI by preventing tubular cell mitochondrial fission through the ERK1/2 / Drp1 pathway. Inhibition of TMEM16A may be a novel therapeutic strategy for AKI.",37402998.txt,0
30957187,miR-27b-3p and miR-607 cooperatively regulate BLM gene expression by directly targeting the 3'-UTR in PC3 cells.,"BLM RecQ like helicase (BLM) has a pivotal role in genetic recombination, transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair, which presents the possibility of using BLM as an anti-cancer target for treatment. However, the post-transcriptional control regulation of BLM gene expression is not fully understood and limits the application of drugs targeting BLM for carcinoma therapy in the future. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit gene expression through interaction with the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of mRNA at the post-transcriptional stage. Therefore, the current study screened for miRNAs that regulate BLM gene expression, with software predicting that miRNA (miR)-27b-3p, miR-607, miR-361-3p, miR-628-5p and miR-338-3p. BLM gene expression levels in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line and RWPE-2 normal prostate epithelium cell line were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Additionally, BLM mRNA levels were following miRNA overexpression for 24 and 48 h. For further miRNA filtration and validation, a dual-luciferase reporter system and western blot analysis were performed, which demonstrated that miR-27b-3p and miR-607 reduce BLM gene expression by directly targeting the BLM mRNA 3'-UTR. A Box-Behnken design experiment suggested that miR-27b-3p and miR-607 have synergetic mutual effects on BLM gene expression. Finally, the suppressive effect of miR-27b-3p and miR-607 on PC3 cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion indicated the benefit of studying BLM as a drug target in cancer. In conclusion, the findings of the current provide evidence that miR-27b-3p and miR-607 have an oncosuppressive function in PC3 cells and cooperatively downregulate BLM expression at the post-transcriptional level.",30957187.txt,1
30985412,Comparison of L-Methyl-11C-Methionine PET With Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Detecting Newly Diagnosed Glioma.,"AIMS: Amino acid PET and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are at the forefront of noninvasive imaging techniques used for detection and subtyping of glioma-suspicious lesions. In this pilot study, we compare L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS for their ability to predict glioma subtypes. METHODS: Nineteen patients with histologically, confirmed newly diagnosed glioma underwent preoperative L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS in 1 diagnostic session. According to the molecular portfolio and histopathologic diagnosis, patients were subdivided in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma, IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma, IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion, and with 1p/19q codeletion subgroups. Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio (TBRmax), creatine, choline, and N-acetyl aspartate peaks were correlated with postoperative histopathologic tumor diagnoses. RESULTS: Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio was highest in glioblastoma patients (4.18) followed by patients with IDH wild-type grade II and III glioma (3.41). The latter TBRmax values were higher compared with those in patients with IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion (1.95) and in patients with IDH-mutant 1p/19q codeleted grade II and III glioma (2.79). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy marker distribution showed no clear trend. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed TBRmax to be the best performing parameter in identifying IDH status (area under the curve, 0.67) and all spectroscopy markers combined in identifying glioma subgroups (area under the curve, 0.68), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: L-Methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS bear limited potential in glioma subgrouping. L-Methyl-C-methionine PET appears to be superior in differentiating IDH status, whereas MRS is more helpful in glioma subgrouping.",30985412.txt,1
38101549,"Sex, Genotype, and Liver Volume Progression as Risk of Hospitalization Determinants in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Liver Disease.","Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease is a rare condition with a female preponderance, based mainly on pathogenic variants in 2 genes, PRKCSH and SEC63. Clinically, autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease is characterized by vast heterogeneity, ranging from asymptomatic to highly symptomatic hepatomegaly. To date, little is known about the prediction of disease progression at early stages, hindering clinical management, genetic counseling, and the design of randomized controlled trials. To improve disease prognostication, we built a consortium of European and US centers to recruit the largest cohort of patients with PRKCSH and SEC63 liver disease.
We analyzed an international multicenter cohort of 265 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease harboring pathogenic variants in PRKCSH or SEC63 for genotype-phenotype correlations, including normalized age-adjusted total liver volumes and polycystic liver disease-related hospitalization (liver event) as primary clinical end points.
Classifying individual total liver volumes into predefined progression groups yielded predictive risk discrimination for future liver events independent of sex and underlying genetic defects. In addition, disease severity, defined by age at first liver event, was considerably more pronounced in female patients and patients with PRKCSH variants than in those with SEC63 variants. A newly developed sex-gene score was effective in distinguishing mild, moderate, and severe disease, in addition to imaging-based prognostication.
Both imaging and clinical genetic scoring have the potential to inform patients about the risk of developing symptomatic disease throughout their lives. The combination of female sex, germline PRKCSH alteration, and rapid total liver volume progression is associated with the greatest odds of polycystic liver disease-related hospitalization.",38101549.txt,0
24750133,The KIT D816V allele burden predicts survival in patients with mastocytosis and correlates with the WHO type of the disease.,"KIT D816V is present in a majority of patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM). We determined the KIT D816V allele burden by quantitative real-time PCR in bone marrow and peripheral blood of 105 patients with mastocytosis. KIT D816V was detected in 92/105 patients (88%). Significant differences in the median allele burden were observed between disease subgroups: cutaneous mastocytosis (0.042%), indolent SM (0.285%), smoldering SM (5.991%), aggressive SM (9.346%), and SM with associated hematologic non-mast cell lineage disease (3.761%) (P < 0.001). The KIT D816V burden also correlated with serum tryptase (R = 0.5, P < 0.005) but not with mast cell infiltration in bone marrow or mediator symptoms. Moreover, the allele burden was of prognostic significance regarding survival (P < 0.01). Patients responding to cytoreductive therapy showed a significant decrease in KIT D816V (P < 0.05). To conclude, the KIT D816V burden correlates with the variant of mastocytosis, predicts survival, and is a valuable follow-up parameter in SM.",24750133.txt,0
36914876,The genetic basis of endometriosis and comorbidity with other pain and inflammatory conditions.,"Endometriosis is a common condition associated with debilitating pelvic pain and infertility. A genome-wide association study meta-analysis, including 60,674 cases and 701,926 controls of European and East Asian descent, identified 42 genome-wide significant loci comprising 49 distinct association signals. Effect sizes were largest for stage 3/4 disease, driven by ovarian endometriosis. Identified signals explained up to 5.01% of disease variance and regulated expression or methylation of genes in endometrium and blood, many of which were associated with pain perception/maintenance (SRP14/BMF, GDAP1, MLLT10, BSN and NGF). We observed significant genetic correlations between endometriosis and 11 pain conditions, including migraine, back and multisite chronic pain (MCP), as well as inflammatory conditions, including asthma and osteoarthritis. Multitrait genetic analyses identified substantial sharing of variants associated with endometriosis and MCP/migraine. Targeted investigations of genetically regulated mechanisms shared between endometriosis and other pain conditions are needed to aid the development of new treatments and facilitate early symptomatic intervention.",36914876.txt,0
31561847,[Identification and management of patients with Lynch syndrome].,"About 5% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases occurred in the context of an underlying hereditary predisposition syndrome. Lynch syndrome is the main causes of hereditary CRC but is also associated with a higher risk of other cancers (such as endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer). It is the consequence of constitutional mutation in a MisMatch Repair (MMR) gene, involved in DNA repair: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2; or of the EPCAM gene (MSH2 promotor). If a mutation predisposing to Lynch Syndrome is identified in an individual, special monitoring should be initiated, adapted to estimated cancer risk. Clinical criteria (Amsterdam II and Bethesda) have been validated to identify the patients who should be referred for genetic counseling in order to initiate constitutional DNA testing. Furthermore, the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) systematically recommend tumoral testing looking for MMR system failure in case of CRC diagnosed under 60, endometrial cancer diagnosed under 50 or whatever the age in patients diagnosed with CRC or endometrial cancer harbouring personal or familal history of Lunch Syndrome cancers. In this review, we will discuss how to detect Lynch syndrome (identification of the index case and family screening) and how to monitor it in 2019.",31561847.txt,1
31242861,DOCK8 mutation diagnosed using whole-exome sequencing of the dried blood spot-derived DNA: a case report of an Iraqi girl diagnosed in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency (MIM #243700) is a rare disease, leads to a combined primary immunodeficiency (PID), and accounts for the autosomal recessive-hyper immunoglobulin E syndrome (AR-HIES). DOCK8 deficiency status characterizes by recurrent infections, atopy, and risk of cancer. Lymphoproliferative disease complicating PID, is difficult to diagnose. Our aim is to present a rare case of PID, and to the best of our knowledge, she is the first case of DOCK8 deficiency from Iraq. The genetic diagnosis was carried out in Japan using dried blood spot-based DNA transfer and whole-exome sequencing. CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-year-old Iraqi girl, of double first-cousin-parents, had a history of severe eczema, food allergy, and repeated infections. She presented with a jaw mass, bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, and immunoglobulin (Ig) assays of 20, 3.3 and 1.7-fold above maximum normal level for age of IgE, IgA and IgG, respectively, along with a low IgM, eosinophilia and lymphopenia. Based on the jaw mass biopsy, non-Hodgkin lymphoma was suggested in Iraq, whereas histopathological re-evaluation in Japan revealed the diagnosis of a polyclonal reactive proliferation spectrum of lymphoproliferative disorders/plasmacytic hyperplasia, complicating PID. Whole-exome sequencing supported the diagnosis of PID by identifying a homozygous DOCK8 mutation with previously reported pathogenicity (NM_203447:c.3332delT, p.Phe1113Leufs*2), that may be attributed to consanguinity. CONCLUSIONS: International collaboration using an effective DNA transportation technique and next-generation sequencing was the key to pinpoint the diagnosis of DOCK8 deficiency. Our case asserted that careful pathogenetic evaluation, in an advanced setting, was crucial for ruling out the neoplastic process. Pediatricians in areas with a high prevalence of consanguinity marriage should have a high index of suspicion of DOCK8 deficiency in patients with recalcitrant eczema, and frequent respiratory and skin infectious episodes.",31242861.txt,1
31239713,Androgen upregulates the palmitoylation of eIF3L in human prostate LNCaP cells.,"Background: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. Most patients diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer can be treated with the main treatment: androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis plays a pivotal role in the progression of prostate cancer. However, most patients can ultimately progress to the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stage within 2 years. At this stage, drugs targeting the AR signaling axis, including enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate, cannot prevent the progression of prostate cancer, thus predicting a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanism lies in the aberrant AR reactivation, which exhibits an adaptive response to ADT, such as the presence of AR splice variants. Thus, CRPC treatment remains a challenge. Purpose: In addition to the AR axis, a mechanism leading to this progression should be determined. The present study mainly compared palmitoylated proteins between androgen-treated LNCaP cells and non-treated LNCaP cells by palmitoylome profiling, to illustrate the changes at proteomic levels. Materials and methods: To screen the androgen-induced palmitoylated proteins, we conducted proteomic experiments using clickable palmitate probe (Alk-C16) between three individual pairs of androgen-treated and non-treated LNCaP cells. Results: We identified 4351 unique peptides corresponding to 835 proteins, among them a number of these identified proteins were palmitoylated proteins, particularly eIF3L. Androgen treatment significantly increased the palmitoylation level of eIF3L, an individual subunit of eIF3. As an initiation factor, eIF3L plays a pivotal role in the translation of mRNAs encoding growth-promoting proteins by enhancing translation rates, thus controlling cell proliferation. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that the regulation of eIF3L palmitoylation may provide new directions for the therapy of prostate cancer. Moreover, the increased level of androgen-induced eIF3L may be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of early-stage prostate cancer.",31239713.txt,1
38057384,Mutational spectrum and phenotypic variability of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and related disorders in a Bangladeshi population.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe rare neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked dystrophin gene. Several mutations have been identified, yet the full mutational spectrum, and their phenotypic consequences, will require genotyping across different populations. To this end, we undertook the first detailed genotype and phenotype characterization of DMD in the Bangladeshi population. We investigated the rare mutational and phenotypic spectrum of the DMD gene in 36 DMD-suspected Bangladeshi participants using an economically affordable diagnostic strategy involving initial screening for exonic deletions in the DMD gene via multiplex PCR, followed by testing PCR-negative patients for mutations using whole exome sequencing. The deletion mapping identified two critical DMD gene hotspot regions (near proximal and distal ends, spanning exons 8-17 and exons 45-53, respectively) that comprised 95% (21/22) of the deletions for this population cohort. From our exome analysis, we detected two novel pathogenic hemizygous mutations in exons 21 and 42 of the DMD gene, and novel pathogenic recessive and loss of function variants in four additional genes: SGCD, DYSF, COL6A3, and DOK7. Our phenotypic analysis showed that DMD suspected participants presented diverse phenotypes according to the location of the mutation and which gene was impacted. Our study provides ethnicity specific new insights into both clinical and genetic aspects of DMD.",38057384.txt,0
30919552,Clinical implications of the genetics of sporadic colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common and at least 80% of cases are sporadic, without any significant family history. Prognostication and treatment have been relatively empirical for what has become increasingly identified as a genetically heterogeneous disease. There are three main genetic pathways in sporadic CRC: the chromosomal instability pathway, the microsatellite instability pathway and the CpG island methylator phenotype pathway. There is significant overlap between these complex molecular pathways and this limits the clinical application of CRC genetics. Recent Australian and New Zealand guidelines recommend routine testing of mismatch repair (MMR) status for new cases of CRC and selective KRAS and BRAF testing on the basis of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. It is important that all clinicians treating CRC have an understanding of the importance of and basis for identifying key genetic features of CRC. It is likely that in the future better molecular characterization such as that allowed by the consensus molecular subtype classification will allow improved prognostication and targeted therapy in order to deliver more personalized treatment for CRC.",30919552.txt,1
31378236,"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Epidemiology, Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment.","Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In the past decade, significant advances have been made in the science of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Screening has been introduced with the goal of early detection. The National Lung Screening Trial found a lung cancer mortality benefit of 20% and a 6.7% decrease in all-cause mortality with the use of low-dose chest computed tomography in high-risk individuals. The treatment of lung cancer has also evolved with the introduction of several lines of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and NTRK mutations. Similarly, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the landscape of NSCLC treatment. Furthermore, the results of new trials continue to help us understand the role of these novel agents and which patients are more likely to benefit; ICIs are now part of the first-line NSCLC treatment armamentarium as monotherapy, combined with chemotherapy, or after definite chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC. Expression of programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 in malignant cells has been studied as a potential biomarker for response to ICIs. However, important drawbacks exist that limit its discriminatory potential. Identification of accurate predictive biomarkers beyond programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 expression remains essential to select the most appropriate candidates for ICI therapy. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the proper sequence and combinations of these new agents; however, the field is moving rapidly, and the overall direction is optimistic.",31378236.txt,1
37888959,<i>Candida albicans</i> exhibits heterogeneous and adaptive cytoprotective responses to antifungal compounds.,"<i>Candida albicans,</i> an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with significant socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, at least in part, because <i>C. albicans</i> can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better characterize this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular single-cell level, we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure (a time when tolerance is measurable), surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, termed the Ribo-dominant (<i>Rd</i>) state; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes, termed the Stress-dominant (<i>Sd</i>) state. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response (RASTR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival.",37888959.txt,0
27259010,CTNNB1 Mutations and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Neuromuscular Choristoma and Its Associated Fibromatosis.,"Neuromuscular choristoma (NMC) is a very rare, developmental malformation characterized by the endoneurial intercalation of mature muscle fibers among peripheral nerve fibers. NMC typically arises in the major proximal peripheral nerves, most commonly the sciatic nerve, and may involve the lumbosacral and brachial plexus. Patients present clinically with progressive neuropathy or plexopathy. NMC is strongly associated with development of a fibromatosis, histologically identical to conventional desmoid-type fibromatosis (NMC-fibromatosis). The development of NMC-fibromatosis is often precipitated by iatrogenic trauma (ie, biopsy). Desmoid-type fibromatosis is characterized by CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, which result in aberrant nuclear beta-catenin localization and dysregulated canonical Wnt signaling. In contrast, the pathogenesis of NMC and NMC-fibromatosis is unknown. Desmoid-type fibromatosis expresses estrogen receptors (ER), specifically the ER-beta isoform (ERbeta), and endocrine therapies may be used in surgically unresectable cases. In contrast, the ER expression profile of NMC-fibromatosis is unknown. We evaluated a series of NMC and NMC-fibromatosis for CTNNB1 mutations, beta-catenin expression, and ER isoform expression. Five NMCs occurred in 2 female and 3 male patients (median age: 14 y, range <1 to 42 y), as masses involving the sciatic nerve (N=4) or brachial plexus (N=1). Four (of 5) NMCs had CTNNB1 mutations: 3 c.134 C>T (p.S45F) and 1 c.121 A>G (p.T41A). Four patients subsequently developed NMC-fibromatosis, and all 4 cases contained CTNNB1 mutations, including 1 p.T41A and 3 p.S45F mutations. In 3 patients, the NMC and NMC-fibromatosis had identical CTNNB1 mutations. Only 1 NMC had no detectable CTNNB1 mutation; however, the patient's subsequent NMC-fibromatosis had a CTNNB1 p.T41A mutation. All NMC and NMC-fibromatosis showed aberrant nuclear localization of beta-catenin, nuclear ERbeta expression, and no ERalpha expression. The presence of CTNNB1 mutations both in NMC and NMC-fibromatosis may be a shared molecular genetic abnormality underlying their pathogenesis.",27259010.txt,0
31102358,[Expression of WT1 gene and its prognostic value in patients with acute myeloid leukemia].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of Wilms'tumor 1 (WT1) gene in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and to explore its application in predicting prognosis of AML in patients with wild or mutated nucleophosmin 1(NPM1) and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). METHODS: One hundred and sixty-seven newly diagnosed AML patients(exclued M3 type) were enrolled in this study. The survival of patients were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method. The clinical data, laboratory findings and the survival of patients were analyzed and compared between patients with high WT1 expression (high-WT1 group) and those with low WT1 expression (low-WT1 group), as well as among the patients with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD wild type and mutants. RESULTS: The overall response rates (ORR) in high-WT1 and low-WT1 groups were 65.9% (83/126) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (P<0.01). Compared with the low-WT1 group, the high-WT1 group had lower 2-y overall survival (OS) rate (46.1% vs. 75.2%, P<0.05) and 2-y disease free survival (DFS) rate (43.5% vs. 68.5%, P<0.05). After induction chemotherapy, the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >= 1log was associated with higher ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), but the advantage of 2-y DFS rate was not shown (P>0.05). In patients with NPM1 wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), while in the patients with FLT3-ITD wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR, 2-y OS rate and 2-y DFS rate (all P<0.05). In patients with NPM1 or FLT3 -ITD mutations, the WT1 expression had no significantly predicting values in treatment efficacy and survival (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: WT1 gene overexpression indicated poor prognosis of AML patients; the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >= 1 log after the first induction therapy show better prognosis than those with<1 log. The WT1 gene expression level at diagnosis can be used as an unfavorable prognostic factor for AML patients with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD wild types.",31102358.txt,1
31467295,Association of caspase 8 polymorphisms -652 6N InsDel and Asp302His with progression-free survival and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in early breast cancer.,"The caspase 8 variants CASP8 -652 6N InsDel and Asp302His have previously been identified to promote survival of T-lymphocytes and to indicate reduced breast cancer susceptibility. Besides some preliminary findings, prognostic relevance of these polymorphisms in patients with existing breast cancer has not been investigated. Considering an immunomodulatory role of these polymorphisms, we genotyped 785 early breast cancer patients and correlated caspase 8 variants with disease-free survival (DFS) and the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Early breast cancer specimens were collected as part of the multicenter prospective PiA study. Genotyping was performed by pyrosequencing, TILs status was assessed using hematoxylin & eosin staining. The CASP8 -652Del variant was significantly associated with improved DFS in an allele-dose dependent manner (p = 0.027). Homozygosity for the -652Del variant was an independent predictor for improved DFS (HR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.174-0.726; p = 0.005). In patients with the 302HisHis genotype, there was no event of recurrence during observation time. Combined analysis of diplotypes revealed an influence of both polymorphisms on DFS (p = 0.029). Interestingly, patients with the 302HisHis variant among the unstratified patient cohort (and among the luminal-like subtype, by trend) had tumors with lower lymphocyte infiltration (p = 0.025). We propose a prognostically favorable role of the -652Del and the 302His variant in primary breast cancer and suggest for the first time an association between polymorphisms in apoptosis-related genes and the immunophenotype in breast cancer. Our findings encourage further investigation of caspase 8 polymorphisms as biomarkers for prognostic and immunotherapeutic considerations.",31467295.txt,1
31109278,A Computer - Aided Drug Designing for Pharmacological Inhibition of Mutant ALK for the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common among all the types of cancer worldwide with 1.8 million people diagnosed every year, leading to 1.6 million deaths every year according to the American cancer society. The involvement of mutated Anaplasic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) positive fusion protein in the progression of NSCLC has made a propitious target to inhibit and treat NSCLC. In the present study, the main motif is to screen the most effective inhibitor against ALK protein with the potential pharmacological profile. The ligands selected were docked with Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) and CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) was the best docked pre-established compound with a permissible pharmacological profile. METHODS: The selected ligands were docked with Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD). With reference to the obtained compound with the lowest re-rank score, PubChem database was virtually screened to retrieve a large set of similar compounds which were docked to find the compound with higher affinity. Further comparative studies and in silico prediction included pharmacophore studies, proximity energy parameters, ADMET and BOILED-egg plot analysis. RESULTS: CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) was the best docked pre-established compound with preferable pharmacological profile and PubChem compound CID-123449015 came out as the most efficient virtually screened inhibitor. Interestingly, the contours of the virtual screened compound PubChem CID- 123449015 fall within our desired high volume cavity of protein having admirable property to control the ALK regulation to prevent carcinogenesis in NSCLC. BOILED-Egg plot analysis depicts that both the compounds have analogous characteristics in the divergent aspects. Moreover, in the evaluations of Blood Brain Barrier, Human Intestinal Absorption, AMES toxicity, and LD50, the virtually screened compound (PubChem CID-123449015) was found within high optimization. CONCLUSION: These investigations denote that the virtually screened compound (PubChem CID- 123449015) is more efficient to be a better prospective candidate for NSCLC treatment having good pharmacological profile than the pre-established compound CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) with low re-rank score. The identified virtually screened compound has high potential to act as an ALK inhibitor and can show promising results in the research of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",31109278.txt,1

30992265,Recommendations for the management of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in adults.,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome induced by aberrantly activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. The primary (genetic) form, caused by mutations affecting lymphocyte cytotoxicity and immune regulation, is most common in children, whereas the secondary (acquired) form is most frequent in adults. Secondary HLH is commonly triggered by infections or malignancies but may also be induced by autoinflammatory/autoimmune disorders, in which case it is called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS; or MAS-HLH). Most information on the diagnosis and treatment of HLH comes from the pediatric literature. Although helpful in some adult cases, this raises several challenges. For example, the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria developed for children are commonly applied but are not validated for adults. Another challenge in HLH diagnosis is that patients may present with a phenotype indistinguishable from sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Treatment algorithms targeting hyperinflammation are frequently based on pediatric protocols, such as HLH-94 and HLH-2004, which may result in overtreatment and unnecessary toxicity in adults. Therefore, dose reductions, individualized tailoring of treatment duration, and an age-dependent modified diagnostic approach are to be considered. Here, we present expert opinions derived from an interdisciplinary working group on adult HLH, sponsored by the Histiocyte Society, to facilitate knowledge transfer between physicians caring for pediatric and adult patients with HLH, with the aim to improve the outcome for adult patients affected by HLH.",30992265.txt,1
31317326,"Synchronicity of genetic variants between primary sites and metastatic lymph nodes, and prognostic impact in nodal metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.","PURPOSE: Nodal positive lung adenocarcinoma includes wide range of survival. Several methods for the classification of nodal-positive lung cancer have been proposed. However, classification considering the impact of targetable genetic variants are lacking. The possibility of genetic variants for the better stratification of nodal positive lung adenocarcinoma was estimated. METHODS: Mutations of 36 genes between primary sites and metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) were compared using next-generation sequencing. Subsequently, mutations in EGFR and BRAF, rearrangements in ALK and ROS1 were evaluated in 69 resected pN1-2M0 adenocarcinoma cases. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), post-recurrence survival (PRS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with respect to targetable variants and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after recurrence. RESULTS: About 90% of variants were shared and allele frequencies were similar between primary and metastatic sites. In 69 pN1-2M0 cases, EGFR/ALK were positive in primary sites of 39 cases and same EGFR/ALK variants were confirmed in metastatic LNs of 96.7% tissue-available cases. Multivariate analyses indicated positive EGFR/ALK status was associated with worse RFS (HR 2.366; 95% CI 1.244-4.500; P = 0.009), and PRS was prolonged in cases receiving TKI therapy (no post-recurrence TKI therapies, HR 3.740; 95% CI 1.449-9.650; P = 0.006). OS did not differ with respect to targetable variants or TKI therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Cases harbouring targetable genetic variants had a higher risk of recurrence, but PRS was prolonged by TKI therapy. Classification according to the targetable genetic status provides a basis for predicting recurrence and determining treatment strategies after recurrence.",31317326.txt,1
36926986,Real-world Experience With Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase Fusion-positive Tumors and Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase Inhibitors in Veterans.,"Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 1-3 (<i>NTRK1-3</i>) gene fusions are found in a broad range of tumor types. Clinical trials demonstrated high response rates to tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitors in <i>NTRK</i> fusion-positive cancers, but few reports have described real-world experience with these targeted agents. We evaluated the prevalence of <i>NTRK</i> fusions and the outcomes with TRK inhibitor therapy in a real-world population of patients in the Veterans Health Administration.
Patients with <i>NTRK</i> fusions or rearrangements were identified from the Veterans Affairs (VA) National Precision Oncology Program (NPOP), and patients who were prescribed TRK inhibitors were identified from the Corporate Data Warehouse. Baseline data and clinical outcomes were obtained by retrospective review of medical records.
A total of 33 patients with <i>NTRK</i> fusions or rearrangements were identified, including 25 patients comprising 0.12% of all patients with solid tumors sequenced through VA NPOP. Twelve patients with <i>NTRK</i> fusions or rearrangements were treated with TRK inhibitors, none of whom had objective responses. Eight patients experienced toxicities leading to drug interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation.
In this retrospective study of VA patients, <i>NTRK</i> fusions and rearrangements were less common than in previous studies, and objective responses to TRK inhibitors were not observed. Real-world experience with TRK inhibitors differs markedly from clinical trial findings, possibly due to differences in patient demographics, tumor types, and sequencing methods. Our findings highlight the need to study TRK inhibitors in the real-world setting and in populations underrepresented in clinical trials.",36926986.txt,1
25578100,Risk factors for anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Symptoms resulting from the activation and release of mediators from the mast cells are observed in about 30% of the patients with mastocytosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anaphylactic reactions and to identify the risk factors for anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis depending on the type of the disease. Furthermore, we analyzed a response to treatment of mediator-related symptoms in this patient group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group included 152 adult patients with mastocytosis. The diagnostic workup included a histopathological examination, flow cytometry, KIT mutation analysis, and measurement of tryptase levels. The diagnosis of allergy was confirmed by the skin prick test and serum immunoglobulin E levels. RESULTS: The prevalence of anaphylactic reactions in the study group was 50% and was higher in patients with systemic mastocytosis (P = 0.007), specifically in its indolent variant (P = 0.026), than in patients with cutaneous mastocytosis. The most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis were food (29%), insect stings (22%), and drugs (15%). Tryptase levels were higher in patients with a history of anaphylaxis (P = 0.029) as well as in those with symptoms provoked by physical factors (P = 0.002). Such symptoms were reported in 112 patients (74%) and were more common in patients with systemic mastocytosis compared with those with cutaneous mastocytosis (P = 0.026). The treatment was ineffective in 8 patients (10.5%) and resulted only in partial remission in 14 patients (18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a significant incidence of symptoms related to physical factors in patients with mastocytosis and anaphylaxis in history.

24908902,A case of late-onset segmental neurofibromatosis.,"Segmental neurofibromatosis (NF5) is a rare variant of neurofibromatosis. To our knowledge, there have been few reports of cases presenting later in life. The recognition of NF5 is important, as there have been reports of paraneoplastic manifestations and transmission to offspring. Here we present the case of a patient who presented with NF5 first appearing in her mid-50s. This case illustrates the subtle nature of NF5, which often leads to misdiagnosis.",24908902.txt,0
38701783,FLT3L governs the development of partially overlapping hematopoietic lineages in humans and mice.,"FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), encoded by FLT3LG, is a hematopoietic factor essential for the development of natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) in mice. We describe three humans homozygous for a loss-of-function FLT3LG variant with a history of various recurrent infections, including severe cutaneous warts. The patients' bone marrow (BM) was hypoplastic, with low levels of hematopoietic progenitors, particularly myeloid and B cell precursors. Counts of B cells, monocytes, and DCs were low in the patients' blood, whereas the other blood subsets, including NK cells, were affected only moderately, if at all. The patients had normal counts of Langerhans cells (LCs) and dermal macrophages in the skin but lacked dermal DCs. Thus, FLT3L is required for B cell and DC development in mice and humans. However, unlike its murine counterpart, human FLT3L is required for the development of monocytes but not NK cells.",38701783.txt,0
37892108,Characterization of New Alpha Zero (α<sup>0</sup>) Thalassaemia Deletion (--<sup>GB</sup>) among Malays in Malaysian Population.,"Malaysia is a multicultural and multiethnic country comprising numerous ethnic groups. From the total population of 32.7 million, Malays form the bulk of the Bumiputera in Malaysia comprise about 69.9%, followed by Chinese 22.8%, Indian 6.6%, and others 0.7%. The heterogeneous population and increasing numbers of non-citizens in this country affects the heterogeneity of genetic diseases, diversity, and heterogeneity of thalassaemia mutations. Alpha (α)-thalassaemia is an inherited haemoglobin disorder characterized by hypochromic microcytic anaemia caused by a quantitative reduction in the α-globin chain. A majority of the α-thalassaemia are caused by deletions in the α-globin gene cluster. Among Malays, the most common deletional alpha thalassaemia is -α<sup>3.7</sup> deletion followed by --<sup>SEA</sup> deletion. We described the molecular characterization of a new --<sup>GB</sup> deletion in our population, involving both alpha genes in <i>cis</i>. Interestingly, we found that this mutation is unique among Malay ethnicities. It is important to diagnose this deletion because of the 25% risk of Hb Bart's with hydrops fetalis in the offspring when in combination with another α<sup>0</sup>- thalassaemia allele. MLPA is a suitable method to detect unknown and uncommon deletions and to characterize those cases which remain unresolved after a standard diagnostic approach.",37892108.txt,0
30389854,WNT/beta-catenin signaling plays a crucial role in myoblast fusion through regulation of nephrin expression during development.,"Skeletal muscle development is controlled by a series of multiple orchestrated regulatory pathways. WNT/beta-catenin is one of the most important pathways for myogenesis; however, it remains unclear how this signaling pathway regulates myogenesis in a temporal- and spatial-specific manner. Here, we show that WNT/beta-catenin signaling is crucial for myoblast fusion through regulation of the nephrin (Nphs1) gene in the Myog-Cre-expressing myoblast population. Mice deficient for the beta-catenin gene in Myog-Cre-expressing myoblasts (Ctnnb1F/F;Myog-Cre mice) displayed myoblast fusion defects, but not migration or cell proliferation defects. The promoter region of Nphs1 contains the conserved beta-catenin-binding element, and Nphs1 expression was induced by the activation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling. The induction of Nphs1 in cultured myoblasts from Ctnnb1F/F;Myog-Cre mice restored the myoblast fusion defect, indicating that nephrin is functionally relevant in WNT/beta-catenin-dependent myoblast fusion. Taken together, our results indicate that WNT/beta-catenin signaling is crucial for myoblast fusion through the regulation of the Nphs1 gene.",30389854.txt,0
36606708,"Sequence analyses of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas unravel three genetic subgroups of patients and the GNA13 mutant as poor prognostic biomarker, results of LNH-EP1 study.","Advances in molecular profiling of newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have recently refine genetic subgroups. Genetic subgroups remain undetermined at the time of relapse or refractory (RR) disease. This study aims to decipher genetic subgroups and search for prognostic molecular biomarkers in patients with RR-DLBCL. From 2015 to 2021, targeted next-generation sequencing analyses of germline-matched tumor samples and fresh tissue from RR-DLBCL patients were performed. Unsupervised clustering of somatic mutations was performed and correlations with patient outcome were sought. A number of 120 patients with RR-DLBCL were included in LNH-EP1 study and a molecular tumor landscape was successfully analyzed in 87% of patients (104/120 tumor samples). The median age was 67.5 years (range 27.4-87.4), median number of previous treatments was 2 (range 1-9). The most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (n = 53 mutations; 42% of samples), CREBBP (n = 39; 32%), BCL2 (n = 86; 31%), KMT2D (n = 39; 28%) and PIM1 (n = 54; 22%). Unsupervised clustering separated three genetic subgroups entitled BST (enriched in BCL2, SOCS1, and TNFRSF14 mutations); TKS (enriched in TP53, KMT2D, and STAT6 mutations); and PCM (enriched in PIM1, CD79B, and MYD88 mutations). Median overall survival (OS) was 11.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1-12.6) months. OS was not significantly different between the three genetic subgroups. GNA13 mutant was significantly associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio: 6.6 [95% CI: 2.1-20.6]; p = .0011) and shorter OS (p = .0340). At the time of relapse or refractory disease, three genetic subgroups of DLBCL patients were delineated, which could help advance precision molecular medicine programs.",36606708.txt,1
25381388,The immunophenotype of mast cells and its utility in the diagnostic work-up of systemic mastocytosis.,"SM comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by an abnormal accumulation of clonal MCs in 1 or more tissues, frequently involving the skin and BM. Despite the fact that most adult patients (>90%) carry the same genetic lesion (D816V KIT mutation), the disease presents with multiple variants with very distinct clinical and biologic features, a diverse prognosis, and different therapeutic requirements. Recent advances in the standardization of the study of BM MC by MFC allowed reproducible identification and characterization of normal/reactive MCs and their precursors, as well as the establishment of the normal MC maturational profiles. Analysis of large groups of patients versus normal/reactive samples has highlighted the existence of aberrant MC phenotypes in SM, which are essential for the diagnosis of the disease. In turn, 3 clearly distinct and altered maturation-associated immunophenotypic profiles have been reported recently in SM, which provide criteria for the distinction between ISM patients with MC-restricted and multilineage KIT mutation; thus, immunphenotyping also contributes to prognostic stratification of ISM, particularly when analysis of the KIT mutation on highly purified BM cells is not routinely available in the diagnostic work-up of the disease.",25381388.txt,0
31337986,YAP promotes multi-drug resistance and inhibits autophagy-related cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma via the RAC1-ROS-mTOR pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistance is the major cause of chemotherapy failure in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). YAP, a critical effector of the Hippo pathway, has been shown to contribute to the progression, metastasis and invasion of cancers. However, the potential role of YAP in mediating drug resistance remains obscure. METHODS: RT-qPCR and western blot were used to assess YAP expression in HCC cell lines. CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry, a xenograft tumour model, immunochemistry and GFP-mRFP-LC3 fusion proteins were utilized to evaluate the effect of YAP on multi-drug resistance, intracellular ROS production and the autophagy of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Autophagy inhibitor and rescue experiments were carried out to elucidate the mechanism by which YAP promotes chemoresistance in HCC cells. RESULTS: We found that BEL/FU, a typical HCC cell line with chemoresistance, exhibited overexpression of YAP. Moreover, the inhibition of YAP by shRNA or verteporfin conferred the sensitivity of BEL/FU cells to chemotherapeutic agents through autophagy-related cell death in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YAP silencing significantly enhanced autophagic flux by increasing RAC1-driven ROS, which contributed to the inactivation of mTOR in HCC cells. In addition, the antagonist of autophagy reversed the enhanced effect of YAP silencing on cell death under treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that YAP upregulation endowed HCC cells with multi-drug resistance via the RAC1-ROS-mTOR pathway, resulting in the repression of autophagy-related cell death. The blockade of YAP may serve as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in HCC.",31337986.txt,1
31302372,Large nested urothelial carcinoma: A clinicopathological study of 22 cases on transurethral resection materials.,"Large nested urothelial carcinoma (LNUC) is a recently recognized variant of urothelial carcinoma (UC), which is characterized with inverted growth pattern and bland cytology. Diagnosis can be extremely challenging, especially in transurethral resection (TUR) materials. Haematoxylin-eosin stained slides of TUR materials with UC, submitted to our department between 2008 and 2017 were re-examined. Twenty-two LNUC cases were found. LNUC frequency was 0.7%. Mean age was 69.9, 82% were male. Mean tumor diameter was 4.9 cm. Non-invasive UC was present in all cases; low-grade in 6, high-grade in 1, low and high-grade in 15. Five and 16 cases were pT1 and pT2, respectively, no invasion was detected in one case. In addition to medium-large nests, small nests and conventional UC areas was present in 2 and 3 cases, respectively. Stroma-tumor interface was irregular in 19 cases and 3 cases had invasive nests with rounded contours. Fibrous stromal reaction and/or stromal lymphoid infiltration were present in 21 cases. Budding, described as small nests in stromal interface of medium-large nests was found in 16 cases. Follow-up was available for 18 cases with an average of 59 months. Four cases had metastasis, 1 patient died of disease. LNUC causes diagnostic difficulty, especially in TUR materials. Large size of tumor, irregularity of nests, presence of stromal reaction and budding can be clues for correct diagnosis.",31302372.txt,1
27323230,The cilium: a cellular antenna with an influence on obesity risk.,"Primary cilia are organelles that are present on many different cell types, either transiently or permanently. They play a crucial role in receiving signals from the environment and passing these signals to other parts of the cell. In that way, they are involved in diverse processes such as adipocyte differentiation and olfactory sensation. Mutations in genes coding for ciliary proteins often have pleiotropic effects and lead to clinical conditions, ciliopathies, with multiple symptoms. In this study, we reviewed observations from ciliopathies with obesity as one of the symptoms. It shows that variation in cilia-related genes is itself not a major cause of obesity in the population but may be a part of the multifactorial aetiology of this complex condition. Both common polymorphisms and rare deleterious variants may contribute to the obesity risk. Genotype-phenotype relationships have been noticed. Among the ciliary genes, obesity differs with regard to severity and age of onset, which may relate to the influence of each gene on the balance between pro- and anti-adipogenic processes. Analysis of the function and location of the proteins encoded by these ciliary genes suggests that obesity is more linked to activities at the basal area of the cilium, including initiation of the intraflagellar transport, but less to the intraflagellar transport itself. Regarding the role of cilia, three possible mechanistic processes underlying obesity are described: adipogenesis, neuronal food intake regulation and food odour perception.",27323230.txt,0
38501195,Rapid measurement of hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation by leveraging Bohr effect and Soret band bathochromic shift.,"Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) binds to hemoglobin (Hb) in the lungs and is then released (dissociated) in the tissues. The Bohr effect is a physiological mechanism that governs the affinity of Hb for O<sub>2</sub> based on pH, where a lower pH results in a lower Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity and higher Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation. Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity and dissociation are crucial for maintaining aerobic metabolism in cells and tissues. Despite its vital role in human physiology, Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement is underutilized in basic research and in clinical laboratories, primarily due to the technical complexity and limited throughput of existing methods. We present a rapid Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement approach by leveraging the Bohr effect and detecting the optical shift in the Soret band that corresponds to the light absorption by the heme group in Hb. This new method reduces Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement time from hours to minutes. We show that Hb deoxygenation can be accelerated chemically at the optimal pH of 6.9. We show that time and pH-controlled deoxygenation of Hb results in rapid and distinct conformational changes in its tertiary structure. These molecular conformational changes are manifested as significant, detectable shifts in Hb's optical absorption spectrum, particularly in the characteristic Soret band (414 nm). We extensively validated the method by testing human blood samples containing normal Hb and Hb variants. We show that rapid Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation can be used to screen for and detect Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity disorders and to evaluate the function and efficacy of Hb-modifying therapies. The ubiquity of optical absorption spectrophotometers positions this approach as an accessible, rapid, and accurate Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement method for basic research and clinical use. We anticipate this method's broad adoption will democratize the diagnosis and prognosis of Hb disorders, such as sickle cell disease. Further, this method has the potential to transform the research and development of new targeted and genome-editing-based therapies that aim to modify or improve Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity.",38501195.txt,0
29177536,Novel biotechnological platform based on baculovirus occlusion bodies carrying Babesia bovis small antigenic peptides for the design of a diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).,"Baculoviruses are large DNA virus of insects principally employed in recombinant protein expression. Its ability to form occlusion bodies (OBs), which are composed mainly of polyhedrin protein (POLH), makes them biotechnologically attractive, as these crystals (polyhedra) can incorporate foreign peptides and can be easily isolated. On the other hand, peptide microarrays allow rapid and inexpensive high-throughput serological screening of new candidates to be incorporated to OBs. To integrate these 2 biotechnological approaches, we worked on Babesia bovis, one of the causative agents of bovine babesiosis. Current molecular diagnosis of infection with B. bovis includes enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques, which use merozoite lysate obtained from infected bovine erythrocytes. However, it is important to produce recombinant antigens that replace the use of crude antigens. Here, we describe a new biotechnological platform for the design of indirect ELISAs based on 5 antigenic peptides of 15 amino acid residues of B. bovis (ApBb), selected from a peptide microarray and expressed as a fusion to POLH. An Sf9POLHE44G packaging cell line infected with recombinant baculoviruses carrying POLH-ApBb fusions yielded higher levels of chimeric polyhedra, highlighting the advantage of a trans-contribution of a mutant copy of polyhedrin. Finally, the use of dissolved recombinant polyhedra as antigens was successful in an ELISA assay, as B. bovis-positive sera recognized the fusion POLH-ApBb. Thus, the use of this platform resulted in a promising alternative for molecular diagnosis of relevant infectious diseases.",29177536.txt,0
31103372,Reactivity with the EpCAM-specific antibodies MOC-31 and Ber-Ep4 in plasma cell neoplasms: a potential diagnostic pitfall in cytology samples.,"OBJECTIVE: Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a protein expressed on surfaces of healthy epithelia, and is overexpressed in dysplasias and carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) utilizing antibodies that react with EpCAM, such as MOC-31 and Ber-EP4, distinguish reactive mesothelial cells from carcinomas in serous effusions. IHC is crucial in effusions with singly dispersed atypical cells, a scenario with a broad differential, including hematopoietic malignancies. Plasma cell neoplasms (PCN) are the second most common hematopoietic malignancy, manifesting as multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma, with 6% of cases developing serous cavity involvement. Most PCNs are readily recognizable; however, variants that deviate from the classic cytomorphology risk erroneous diagnosis. This study demonstrates EpCAM expression in a subset of PCNs, highlighting a potential diagnostic pitfall in serous effusion cytology. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective search for cytology specimens with a diagnosis of PCN was performed. All cases demonstrating CD138/CD38 and monoclonal immunoglobulin expression, and adequately cellular cell block were included. IHC analysis for MOC-31 and Ber-EP4 was performed using Ventana Benchmark Ultra. Scoring was performed as follows: total IHC score equals the positive proportion (0 = no positive tumor cells; 1 = <1%; 2 = 1-10%; 3 =11-33%; 4 = 34-66%; 5 = 67-100%) plus staining intensity (0, no staining; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong). A score > 4 was considered positive. RESULTS: 2 of 28 (7%) PCNs demonstrated positivity for MOC-31 and Ber-Ep4. CONCLUSION: A subset of PCNs in cytology samples show positivity for MOC-31 and Ber-EP4 which could result in misinterpretation as carcinoma.",31103372.txt,1
31083279,Oncogenic Effect of the Novel Fusion Gene VAPA-Rab31 in Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"Fusion genes have been identified as oncogenes in several solid tumors including lung, colorectal, and stomach cancers. Here, we characterized the fusion gene, VAPA-Rab31, discovered from RNA-sequencing data of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who did not harbor activating mutations in EGFR, KRAS and ALK. This fusion gene encodes a protein comprising the N-terminal region of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAPA) fused to the C-terminal region of Ras-related protein 31 (Rab31). Exogenous expression of VAPA-Rab31 in immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated the potential transforming effects of this fusion gene, including increased colony formation and cell proliferation in vitro. Also, enhanced tumorigenicity upon VAPA-Rab31 was confirmed in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. Metastatic tumors were also detected in the liver and lungs of xenografted mice. Overexpression of VAPA-Rab31 upregulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and phosphorylated CREB both in cells and xenograft tumors. Reduced apoptosis and increased phosphorylation of CREB and Erk were observed in VAPA-Rab31-overexpressing cells after bortezomib treatment. Elevated Bcl-2 level via activated CREB contributed to the resistance to the bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest the oncogenic function of the novel fusion gene VAPA-Rab31 via upregulated Bcl-2 and activated CREB in lung cancer.",31083279.txt,1
26748894,"Spleen enlargement is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: Evaluation on 1,297 patients.","Spleen enlargement, present in 10-20% of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) patients at diagnosis, is a feature clinically easy to assess, confirmable by echography with a very low chance of misinterpretation. Nonetheless, the clinical and prognostic role of splenomegaly has been seldom evaluated. From 1979 to 2013, 1297 ET patients retrospectively collected in the database of the Lazio Cooperative Group and Bologna University Hospital were evaluable for spleen enlargement at diagnosis and included in the analysis. On the whole, spleen was enlarged in 172/1297 (13.0%) patients; in most cases (94.8%) splenomegaly was mild (<=5 cm). Patients with splenomegaly were younger, predominantly male, presented higher platelet count and JAK2V617F allele burden and had a lower incidence of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. At least one thrombotic event during follow-up occurred in 97/1,125 (8.6%) patients without spleen enlargement compared to 27/172 (15.7%) patients with spleen enlargement (P = 0.003). Despite comparable use of cytoreductive/antiplatelet therapies in the two groups, the cumulative risk of thrombosis at 5 years was significantly higher in patients with baseline splenomegaly (9.8% versus 4.4% in patients without splenomegaly, P = 0.012). In multivariate analysis exploring risk factors for thrombosis, splenomegaly retained its negative prognostic role, together with previous thrombosis, leucocyte count and male gender. Baseline splenomegaly seems to be an independent additional risk factor for thrombosis in nonstrictly WHO-defined ET patients. This data could be useful in the real-life clinical management of these patients.",26748894.txt,0
31426864,18F-FDG-PET-based Radiomics signature predicts MGMT promoter methylation status in primary diffuse glioma.,"BACKGROUND: The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter has emerged as a favorable independent prognostic and predictive biomarker in glioma. This study aimed to build a radiomics signature based on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for noninvasive measurement of the MGMT promoter methylation status in glioma. METHODS: One hundred and seven pathology-confirmed primary diffuse glioma patients were retrospectively included and randomly assigned to the primary (n = 71) or validation cohort (n = 36). The MGMT promoter methylation status was measured by pyrosequencing. A total of 1561 radiomics features were extracted from the three-dimensional region of interest (ROI) on the standard uptake value (SUV) maps that were generated from the original 18F-FDG PET data. A radiomics signature, a clinical signature and a fusion signature that combined the clinical and radiomics features together were generated. The performance of the three signatures was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the patient prognosis was stratified based on the MGMT promoter methylation status and the signature with the best performance. RESULTS: Five radiomics features were selected to construct the radiomics signature, and displayed the best performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) reaching 0.94 and 0.86 in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively, which outweigh the performances of clinical signature and fusion signature. With a median follow-up time of 32.4 months, the radiomics signature stratified the glioma patients into two risk groups with significantly different prognoses (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FDG-PET-based radiomics is a promising approach for preoperatively evaluating the MGMT promoter methylation status in glioma and predicting the prognosis of glioma patients noninvasively.",31426864.txt,1
38438086,MicroRNA-7 Attenuates Secondary Brain Injury Following Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage via Inhibition of NLRP3.,"The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying brain injury resulting from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remain incompletely elucidated, and efficacious therapeutic interventions to enhance the prognosis of ICH patients are currently lacking. Previous research indicates that MicroRNA-7 (miR-7) can suppress the expression of Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), thereby modulating neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. However, the potential regulatory effects miR-7 on NLRP3 inflammasome after ICH are yet to be established. This study aims to ascertain whether miR-7 mitigates secondary brain injury following experimental ICH by inhibiting NLRP3 and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.
An ICH model was established by stereotaxically injecting 100 μL of autologous blood into the right basal ganglia of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Subsequently, these rats were allocated into three groups: sham, ICH + Vehicle, and ICH + miR-7, each comprising 18 animals. Twelve hours post-modeling, rats received intraventricular injections of 10 μL physiological saline, 10 μL phosphate, and 10 μL phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.5 nmol of miR-7 mimics, respectively. Neurological function was assessed on day three post-modeling, followed by euthanasia for brain tissue collection. Brain water content was determined using the dry-wet weight method. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in cerebral tissues surrounding the hematoma was analyzed through immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays. These cytokines were re-evaluated using Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, bioinformatics tools were employed to predict miR-7's binding to NLRP3. A wild-type luciferase reporter gene vector and a corresponding mutant vector were constructed, followed by transfection of miR-7 mimics into HEK293T cells to assess luciferase activity.
Our study demonstrates that the administration of miR-7 mimics markedly reduced neurological function scores and attenuated brain edema in rats following ICH. A significant upregulation of NLRP3 expression in microglia/macrophage adjacent to the hematoma was observed, substantially reduced after the treatment with miR-7 mimics. Furthermore, this intervention ameliorated neurodegenerative changes and effectively decreased the protein and mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and Caspase1, in the cerebral tissues proximate to the hematomas. In addition, miR-7 mimics distinctly inhibited the luciferase activity associated with the wild-type reporter gene, an effect not mirrored in its mutant variant.
The miR-7 suppressed NLRP3 expression in microglia/macrophage to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines, leading to conducting certain neuroprotection post-ICH in rats.",38438086.txt,0

31354263,"Photothermal effects of NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 superparamagnetic nanoprobes in the treatment of melanoma.","Objective: The study aimed to synthesize superparamagnetic NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 upconversion nanoprobes and to study their photothermal effects for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Methods: Morphological characteristics of the synthesized nanoprobes were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Their biocompatibility and biodistribution profiles were assessed through blood routine/biochemistry tests and the inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometry-based analysis of tissue metal elements. Their photothermal conversion efficiency and their potential as contrast agents for upconversion luminescence (UCL)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual-modal imaging were tested. Efficacy in photothermal therapy, which was achieved by combining nanoprobes with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, was evaluated in both A375 cell line and BALB/c mice models. The underlying mechanisms were interrogated by molecular approaches including the MTT assay, flow cytometry, semiquantitative PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Results: 1) Our synthesized NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 nanoprobes exhibited a uniform cubic morphology with a diameter of ~50 nm. Subcutaneous administration led to no severe, long-lasting adverse effects in mice, possibly due to complete removal of these nanomaterials within one month. 2) Our nanoprobes possessed superior photothermal conversion efficiency and strong contrasting effects during UCL/MRI dual-modal imaging, corroborating their applications in imaging-guided photothermal therapy. 3) Combinatorial treatment of these nanoprobes with NIR irradiation induced profound apoptosis/necrosis in A375 cells. Similarly, the same treatment modality led to strong therapeutic effects in BALB/c mice implanted with A375 tumor xenografts. Mechanistic studies suggested an involvement of heat shock protein 70 in mediating the observed antitumor effects of our nanoprobes. Conclusion: Our study describes a convenient method to synthesize a new type of superparamagnetic upconversion nanoprobes, which possess high biocompatibility and can be used in imaging-guided photothermal therapy for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Importantly, our findings will promote clinical applications of NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 as novel theranostic agents in treating melanoma and many other tumors.",31354263.txt,1
31168000,[Latent essential thrombocythemia becoming perceptible after splenectomy].,"A 47-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of left hypochondrium part pain and was diagnosed with splenomegaly with splenic infarctions in May 2016. His complete blood cell count was almost within normal limits, and a bone marrow biopsy revealed normal cellularity with no fibrosis. In addition, no abnormal uptake was noted on FDG PET/CT. In August 2016, he underwent splenectomy for splenomegaly. The histological examination revealed fibrotic stenosis of the blood vessels in the spleen. After splenectomy, his platelet count elevated and remained at >1,000x109/l 3 months later. Finally, he was diagnosed with latent essential thrombocythemia (ET) because the JAK2V617F mutation was positive. Accordingly, oral hydroxyurea was initiated. Thrombosis could be a complication in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). In our case, ET was masked, perhaps, because of hypersplenism and splenomegaly because of splenic vein thrombosis.

Overall, 60 patients with gliomas were enrolled. The intermediate and perfusion-related diffusion coefficients (D<sub>int</sub> and D<sub>p</sub>) and fractions of strictly limited, intermediate, and perfusion-related diffusion (F<sub>very-slow</sub>, F<sub>int</sub>, and F<sub>p</sub>) were obtained with a three-component diffusion model. Parameters were also obtained from a diffusion kurtosis model and mono- and biexponential models. All parameters were compared between different tumor grades and IDH-1 gene types. Diagnostic performance and logistic regression analyses were performed.
High-grade gliomas (HGGs) had significantly higher F<sub>int</sub>, F<sub>very-slow</sub>, and D<sub>p</sub> values but significantly lower F<sub>p</sub> and D<sub>int</sub> values than low-grade gliomas (LGGs), and F<sub>int</sub> and F<sub>p</sub> differed significantly among grade II, III, and IV gliomas (p < 0.05 for all). F<sub>int</sub> achieved the highest AUC of 0.872 in differentiating between LGGs and HGGs. Logistic regression analysis revealed that in each model, F<sub>int</sub>, diffusion coefficient (D), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), mean diffusivity (MD), and mean kurtosis (MK) were associated with glioma grading. After multiple regression analysis, F<sub>int</sub> remained the only differentiator. Additionally, F<sub>int</sub> and F<sub>p</sub> showed significant differences between IDH-1 mutated and IDH-1 wild-type gliomas (p = 0.007 and 0.01, respectively).
The three-component DWI model served as a useful biomarker for detecting microstructural features in gliomas with different grades and IDH-1 mutation statuses.
• The three-component model enables the estimation of an intermediate diffusion component. • The three-component model performed better than the other models in glioma grading and genotyping. • F<sub>int</sub> was useful in evaluating the grade and genotype of gliomas.",36346441.txt,1
38211722,Detection of Constitutional Structural Variants by Optical Genome Mapping: A Multisite Study of Postnatal Samples.,"Optical genome mapping is a high resolution technology that can detect all types of structural variations in the genome. This second phase of a multisite study compares the performance of optical genome mapping and current standard of care methods for diagnostic testing of individuals with constitutional disorders including neurodevelopmental impairments and congenital anomalies. Among the 627 analyses in phase 2, 405 were of retrospective samples supplied by five diagnostic centers in the United States and 94 were prospective samples collected over 18 months by two diagnostic centers (June 2021 - October 2022). Additional samples represented a family cohort to determine inheritance (n=119) and controls (n=9). Full concordance of results between optical genome mapping and one or more standard of care diagnostic tests was 98.6% (618/627) with partial concordance in an additional 1.1% (7/627).",38211722.txt,0
30875581,Aggressive variants of prostate cancer - Are we ready to apply specific treatment right now?,"Recently, adoption of novel drugs for systemic treatment of metastatic prostate cancer has led to a striking improvement of response rate and survival in both hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease. In most cases, prostate cancer essentially depends on androgen receptor signaling axis, even in castration-resistant setting, and hence may be targeted by second generation hormonal therapy. However, a subset of patients bears androgen-independent cancer biology with a short-term response to hormonal treatment, early and extensive visceral metastases, low PSA levels and poor outcomes. Identification and specific management of these rapidly fatal malignancies is of an unmet medical need since their classification and utilized therapeutic regimens vary significantly. Unfortunately, molecular pathways have not been sufficiently elucidated yet in order to provide an effective targeted treatment with a prolonged response. Lack of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for these cancers makes successful counteractions against them even more sophisticated. In this comprehensive review, we aimed at summarizing the current body of literature reporting on causal molecular machinery as well as diagnostic and therapeutic concepts of aggressive prostate tumors and draw clinically relevant conclusions for the up-to-date sensible disease management.",30875581.txt,1
30918505,Senecavirus A 3C Protease Mediates Host Cell Apoptosis Late in Infection.,"Senecavirus A (SVA), an oncolytic picornavirus used for cancer treatment in humans, has recently emerged as a vesicular disease (VD)-causing agent in swine worldwide. Notably, SVA-induced VD is indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and other high-consequence VDs of pigs. Here we investigated the role of apoptosis on infection and replication of SVA. Given the critical role of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway on modulation of cell death, we first assessed activation of NF-kappaB during SVA infection. Results here show that while early during infection SVA induces activation of NF-kappaB, as evidenced by nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB-p65 and NF-kappaB-mediated transcription, late in infection a cleaved product corresponding to the C-terminus of NF-kappaB-p65 is detected in infected cells, resulting in lower NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Additionally, we assessed the potential role of SVA 3C protease (3Cpro) in SVA-induced host-cell apoptosis and cleavage of NF-kappaB-p65. Transient expression of SVA 3Cpro was associated with cleavage of NF-kappaB-p65 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), suggesting its involvement in virus-induced apoptosis. Most importantly, we showed that while cleavage of NF-kappaB-p65 is secondary to caspase activation, the proteolytic activity of SVA 3Cpro is essential for induction of apoptosis. Experiments using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK confirmed the relevance of late apoptosis for SVA infection, indicating that SVA induces apoptosis, presumably, as a mechanism to facilitate virus release and/or spread from infected cells. Together, these results suggest an important role of apoptosis for SVA infection biology.",30918505.txt,1
36804622,ROS1 as a possible prognostic biomarker of cervical adenocarcinoma: An exploratory analysis with next-generation sequencing.,"Given the differences in clinical and biological characteristics between cervical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, this study aimed to conduct an exploratory analysis to examine the molecular characteristics of cervical adenocarcinoma in a Japanese population.
This study explored the simultaneous testing of multiple mutations targeting cervical adenocarcinoma using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The following genes were analyzed: BCAR4, CD274, PDCD1LG2, KRAS, ARID1A, PTEN, ALK, EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, PIK3CA, EP300, EBXW7, SHCBP1, TGFBR2, SMAD4, ERBB2, ERBB3, and KLF5. Tumor tissue and blood samples were obtained at the time of primary treatment. The NGS-based molecular profiles obtained from Tokai University (49 specimens) were compared with the registered data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (133 specimens).
The study cohort had higher rates of adenocarcinoma than the TCGA cohort (44.9% vs. 18.0%; P = 0.001). The adenocarcinomas in the study cohort had more alterations in ROS1, EGFR, EP300, SHCBP1, ALK, and PIK3CA than those in the TCGA cohort. Among them, ROS1 had the highest number of gene alterations (median, 7.00 ± 2.63). In the study cohort, patients with a high number of ROS1 alterations had a significantly higher recurrence rate (5-year recurrence rate, 48.8% vs. 14.6%; hazard ratio [HR], 4.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-15.50; P = 0.014) and lower overall survival than those with low alterations (5-year survival rate, 70.7% vs. 93.1%; HR, 7.15; 95% CI, 1.08-58.22; P = 0.032).
The current exploratory analysis suggests that ROS1 gene alteration may be a prognostic biomarker in cervical adenocarcinoma in Japanese patients.",36804622.txt,1
31655381,2D magnetic MoS2-Fe3O4 hybrid nanostructures for ultrasensitive exosome detection in GMR sensor.,"Exosome released from cells plays an important role in intercellular communication and show great clinical potential in early cancer screening and prognosis. Herein, an ultrasensitive Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) biosensor was developed for exosome detection, which was based on 2D MoS2-Fe3O4 nanostructures (MOFE) as magnetic responsive probes for signal amplification. The MOFE can be readily synthesized with simple phase transfer method. Compared to pure Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), the layered MoS2 function as a template for recruiting high loading density of MNPs as magnetic probes. After modified by aptamer, we discover that the 2D magnetic MOFE hybrid nanostructures enable both multidentate targeting and multi-magnetic particle-based signal amplification, increasing the magnetic sensor performance, especially in sensitivity and output signal. Moreover, the 2D magnetic nanocomposites afford high selectivity and excellent reproducibility with detection limit of 100 exosomes in GMR sensor. Results demonstrate that the magnetic strategy based on 2D structures introduced here provide a new dimension for exosome detection, which show great potential of engineering 2D magnetic nanobioprobes for GMR based liquid biopsy application.",31655381.txt,1
31413087,IL6R-STAT3-ADAR1 (P150) interplay promotes oncogenicity in multiple myeloma with 1q21 amplification.,"1q21 amplification is an important prognostic marker in multiple myeloma. In this study we identified that IL6R (the interleukin-6 membrane receptor) and ADAR1 (an RNA editing enzyme) are critical genes located within the minimally amplified 1q21 region. Loss of individual genes caused suppression to the oncogenic phenotypes, the magnitude of which was enhanced when both genes were concomitantly lost. Mechanistically, IL6R and ADAR1 collaborated to induce a hyper-activation of the oncogenic STAT3 pathway. High IL6R confers hypersensitivity to interleukin-6 binding, whereas, ADAR1 forms a constitutive feed-forward loop with STAT3 in a P150-isoform-predominant manner. In this respect, ADAR1-P150 acts as a direct transcriptional target for STAT3 and this STAT3-induced-P150 in turn directly interacts with and stabilizes the former protein, leading to a larger pool of proteins acting as oncogenic transcription factors for pro-survival genes. The importance of both IL6R and ADAR1-P150 in STAT3 signaling was further validated when concomitant knockdown of both genes impeded IL6-induced-STAT3 pathway activation. Clinical evaluation of various datasets of myeloma patients showed that low expression of either one or both genes was closely associated with a compromised STAT3 signature, confirming the involvement of IL6R and ADAR1 in the STAT3 pathway and underscoring their essential role in disease pathogenesis. In summary, our findings highlight the complexity of the STAT3 pathway in myeloma, in association with 1q21 amplification. This study therefore reveals a novel perspective on 1q21 abnormalities in myeloma and a potential therapeutic target for this cohort of high-risk patients.",31413087.txt,1
30884806,Telomeres and Telomerase in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"The role of telomere biology and telomerase activation in skin cancers has been investigated in melanoma and basal cell carcinoma but limited evidence is available for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). We will review the current knowledge on the role of telomere and telomerase pathway in cSCC pathogenesis. At the somatic level, both long and short telomere lengths have been described in cSCC. This telomere dichotomy is probably related to two different mechanisms of tumour initiation which determines two tumour subtypes. Telomere shortening is observed during the invasive progression from in situ forms of cSCC, such as Bowen's disease (BD) and actinic keratosis (AK), to invasive cSCC. At the germline level, controversial results have been reported on the association between constitutive telomere length and risk of cSCC. Approximately 75-85% of cSCC tumours are characterized by a high level of telomerase activity. Telomerase activation has been also reported in AKs and BD and in sun-damaged skin, thus supporting the hypothesis that UV modulates telomerase activity in the skin. Activating TERT promoter mutations have been identified in 32-70% of cSCCs, with the majority showing the UV-signature. No significant correlation was observed between TERT promoter mutations and cSCC clinico-pathological features. However, TERT promoter mutations have been recently suggested to be independent predictors of an adverse outcome. The attention on telomere biology and telomerase activity in cSCC is increasing for the potential implications in the development of effective tools for prognostic assessment and of therapeutic strategies in patients with cutaneous cSCC.",30884806.txt,1
30207489,The Italian Mastocytosis Registry: 6-year experience from a hospital-based registry.,"AIM: We collected 'real-life' data on the management of patients with mastocytosis in the Italian Mastocytosis Registry. METHODS: Six hundred patients diagnosed with mastocytosis between 1974 and 2014 were included from 19 centers. RESULTS: Among adults (n = 401); 156 (38.9%) patients were diagnosed with systemic mastocytosis. In 212 adults, no bone marrow studies were performed resulting in a provisional diagnosis of mastocytosis of the skin. This diagnosis was most frequently established in nonhematologic centers. In total, 182/184 pediatric patients had cutaneous mastocytosis. We confirmed that in the most patients with systemic mastocytosis, serum tryptase levels were >20 ng/ml and KIT D816V was detectable. CONCLUSION: The Italian Mastocytosis Registry revealed some center-specific approaches for diagnosis and therapy. Epidemiological evidence on this condition is provided.",30207489.txt,0
30987669,LINC01354 interacting with hnRNP-D contributes to the proliferation and metastasis in colorectal cancer through activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to play an important role in the development and progression of various tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the regulatory molecular mechanism by lncRNA in CRC initiation and progression has not been fully clarified. METHODS: TCGA database was used to identify the involvement of LINC01354 in CRC. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to determine RNA and protein expression. The gain- and loss-of-function assays were conducted to explore the function of LINC01354 in the progression of CRC. In order to investigate the LINC01354-mediated mRNA in CRC tumorigenesis, we applied the profiling analysis as well as GO and KEGG analysis. Pulldown and RIP assays were applied to detect the interaction of hnRNP-D with LINC01354 and beta-catenin. RESULTS: The upregulation of LINC01354 in CRC and its prognostic significance were identified by TCGA database and confirmed in CRC tissues. Functionally, forced expression of LINC01354 promoted, while knockdown of LINC01354 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and EMT phenotype formation of CRC cells. A significant enrichment of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway genes under LINC01354 overexpression. In addition, LINC01354 modulated the mRNA stability of beta-catenin through interacting with hnRNP-D, thereby activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations proposed novel regulatory axis of LINC01354/hnRNP-D/Wnt/beta-catenin, which might be in favor of exploring novel therapeutic regimens for the clinical treatment of CRC.",30987669.txt,1
31248429,Case report: mutation analysis of primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma via whole-exome sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is a rare tumor subtype accounting for around 0.9% of lung cancers. At present, research on LELC mainly focuses on pathological diagnosis, while the molecular mutation landscape is still unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old female presented a productive cough for three weeks followed by severe symptoms for another week. Respiratory sounds were weak and coarser in the right lung field. F-FDG PET-CTA showed a hypermetabolic mass in the upper lobe of the right lung as well as the enlargement of right hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry staining of the biopsy established the diagnosis of primary pulmonary LELC. After thoracoscopic-assisted radical resection of right lung cancer and middle lobe of right lung, the patient's vital signs were stable without apparent productive cough, chest pain, chest tightness and other subjective discomforts. Furtherwhole exome sequencing of the patient's tumor tissue and leukocytes (served as a germline mutation control) revealed 613 somatic gene mutations, and of which mutations in PRIM2, KCNB1, CDH1, and ATRX were most likely related to the LELC pathogenesis. The recurrence of gene mutations from various cancers database and a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 18.7 mutations/mb were revealed as well. CONCLUSION: Our findings have illustrated the genomic profile of a primary pulmonary LELC case and provided a positive biomarker that immune checkpoint blockade is potentially effective for this patient in further treatment.",31248429.txt,1
